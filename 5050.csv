I purchased these to replace my third pair of 'wired' Bose Quite Comfort headphones. I love them!!!!!,0
I have this small bluetooth speaker pass week and this is perfect for outdoor activity like going to beach. Its waterproof and has a small footprint so you can carry it to anywhere I wish they made the battery life little longer but for the size this is great,0
I spend about 4 hours a day on my computer and listen to my iTunes library while I do. So my wife won't be bothered I use headphones and JBL's over the ear E35 are the best I have found for the price. They are comfortable and deliver great sound quality.,0
Color is great,0
very comfortable,0
Excellent build quality. Mated with Polk RTA 12c's it's in the front end of an awesome Home Theater. The 12c's are over 18 yrs old and still sound great. These 3 speakers will be the front three as long as i live..,0
I've loved Polk Audio once I've heard them at friend's home. I picked these over TRi10's because I knew I'm gonna need a woofer. All I wanted from my speakers was power & and clarity. Bass,0
These are nice speakers for the money I bought mine At Frys outpost. I also own a pair of Monitor 60s and these sound every bit as good and alot cheaper nice speaker for movie watching or music.,0
Pretty good speaker,0
I went to the Bose shop and my first reaction was,0
I replaced my JL Audio set up with the SR6500 and the sound quality is simply amazing. By far the best speaker for the money,0
Im a newbie to the world of HT and im looking forward to having some really great times with this sub. Thank you Matthew Polk . Maybe i'll switch all of my speakers to Polk.Hmmmmmmm,0
I just purchase these headphones. I bought it cause I want a headphone that has great sound overall and I also like bass can anybody explain how great the bass is?,0
I work in an open office,0
I needed something for our motorhome so went to my local John Lewis for them to demonstrate it,0
I brought this for my birthday over beats and I am very happy I made that decision. Very comfy and light and stay snug during athletic activities. I get great usage out of them and wear them everywhere even during football warmups. The battery life is crazy and the sound is wonderful.,0
Have been shopping around for the last year or so for a sound bar that can handle a 20 x 20 great room without going over my 1000 dollar budget...came in well under and was amazed how it brought my old TV to life!!!  Been a JBL customer for over 40 years and yes they still BRING IT!!!,0
I bought this headphones two years ago,0
I bought headphones a month a go,0
"A major improvement over the speakers in our 42"" Sharp Aquos. Makes PBS Brit programs and DVD's understandable. Also replaced the free standing speakers for the stereo.  The sound for the size is impressive.  Don't expect a live concert hall sound",0
I haven't had this mic long but,0
i bought this product 2 weeks ago and it works as intended and the clarity of the sound is very good. Only issue was there is no volume button to it.,0
JBL does it again! From the packaging to the new features... These headphones are great! The stylish look and crisp sounds - PERFECTION!! I purchased some wireless heads phones in the past from JBL,0
These speakers are awesome. I have a 7.1 setup with this center channel,0
I've bought cheap speakers before and they were always lackluster,0
This is a great little speaker for the size. I own JBL floorstandind and bookshelf spreakers so I know great sound when I hear it. I should have bought 2 of these while they where on sale,0
I could not connect via bluetooth. I only can use this via wifi ethernet. I could not see the bluetooth option in setting menu.,0
This is the best speakers that anyone needs. The dual ten inch sub is unbelieveable. My neighbor's one street over can hear the sound that these speakers putout.,0
I have never bought a piece of electronics that I was more happier with,0
Not sure why the negative comments here....this is by far the best bluetooth speaker on the market. The sound is AWESOME...the battery life is AWESOME...basically,0
I was a blown away at how easy this product was to setup.  Just download the app,0
We live around water and have peace of mind knowing that if it gets splashed on that it'll work without a hitch!,0
The ad boasts camo more than any other color,0
If this had the ability to be controlled remotely,0
"I saw the video first and was like ""wO"" these look sweet-and then came here and checked the specs-and i knew i had to get some. Turned out my friend was getting these exact ones",0
These head phones fit into my ear PERFECTLY. The only time they ever come out is if i accidentally yank them hard enough. I've never had any other problems with them. The sound quality is great. I can't say enough about how much I love them!,0
sound is perfect ,0
I bought the SWC yesterday,0
Now that is a pair of speaks! Installed in rear of my '92 Volvo,0
They are really great and reliable to use it just sucks you need the right earbud to listen to the left one,0
Excellent system it has given me a renewed interest in the radio and my CD collection.Quality of sound is absolutely fantastic,0
I bought this sub a week ago after thoroughly comparing several name brands such as velodine and infinity,0
I recently purchased the QC 25's as I'm in school and can't study with surrounding noise. I love them. Wish I bought them earlier. Most definitely recommend.,0
I bought them a month ago to use at the gym. I have been impressed with them since day one. Great sound and value. Could not be anymore pleased. Only reason not a five star is the cord seem to tangle easily,0
The sound is amazing. Bass is awesome no distortion. It sounds great even turned all the way up. The only thing I wish it could do is charge my iPhone. And I think that's just bc it can charge Smartphones. Lol Very happy with my purchase. Totally worth the cost!,0
I bought the Soundlink III a week ago and am very happy with my purchase.  It is very easy to use and the volume is louder than I thought it would be.  For what it is intended to be used for it is hard to beat.,0
It was easy to link and the sound is really good for a smaller blue tooth speaker. My teen son is pleased with it.,0
They love their gift and can't wait to attach the speaker to their backpacks.  My girls are busy athletes and love music.  Perfect gift.  Seems very durable,0
A friend recommended that I should try Polk Audio speakers,0
Simply amazing. The price is right along with the quality of music. I bought my system a year ago,0
Once u hear the sound touch,0
Bought this on Thanksgiving day weekend so far its so good. The quality of music and the charging stays too long. i would recommend it.,0
I bought a few weeks ago and have enjoyed the sound quality and comfort. Would purchase again in future.,0
I am really happy to be able to wholeheartedly recommend this wonderful Wave radio-cd player. Sounds amazing and it is crystal clear. Thank you,0
I love my new Bose speaker. I purchased it for myself and I'm glad I did!!The sound is great love it. I will definitely recommend it to all my friends. I wish they had a carrying case.,0
Bought this having seen it in stores. It's really great sound quality,0
"I bought these a few weeks ago and they're really good. Sound quality is amazing. Bass is good and the quality of sound is good. The only aspect this lacks is ""Noise Cancellation"". The noise cancellation on this is similar to the earphones which cost 10x less.",0
Refurbished but in like new condition.  Good sound.  Nice touch that it comes with the pouch and free shipping. Wish the plug to the wall is smaller.,0
I bought the JBL charge 2 about a month ago after my beats pill failed me. This speaker is the best one I've ever boughten. Compared to the beats pill,0
An awesome center channel and a great price! This center channel puts many other more expensive ones to shame. It has great sound quality and more than sufficient power handling. Paired with other choice Polk speakers it’s a great addition to balance out any home theater even on a budget.,0
The JBL Flip2 is my 2nd product from them and I love it,0
I bought these and my wife stopped snoring.   In all seriousness these shut out the outside world perfectly.    It felt strange at first to have them in my ears all night but after a month I'm used to them.     I sleep longer and better than I have in years.,0
I bought this a month ago but unfortunately i returned it because of lack of bass but the highs and mids are perfect!!! I hope bose will add just a little volume of the bass..,0
It is a good easy to setup system. The best thing is connectivity with Bluetooth and Wifi as well,0
Took a little while to get the ear buds to fit but once I got it,0
You can not hear a single thing through them while music is playing. They fit really comfortably on you and they even have breathing earmuffs so you won't sweat in them. The sound quality is amazing and they also play really good electronic notes being made for acoustic.,0
bought this for my dad and am so glad he uses it instead of risking dropping it or having some strange hip carrier!,0
Great system,0
Super happy with this product. It connects to my bluetooth really fast! The battery life is unexpectedly long like 5 hours!,0
Just got them yesterday. Loved them to bits until I climbed the saddle. There is a lot of aeroacoustic noise which is present when cycling because of poor engineering decisions. So if you are planning to bike around and need music,0
We installed these when we remodeled our kitchen 2 years ago. They have been exceptional speakers and are on most every day,0
I was reluctant to buy this JBL without hearing it,0
I bought these for my brother as a Christmas gift because I knew that AKG has excellent customer service and that product wasn't too expensive either.,0
I couldn't be happier. It sounds amazing! :) But,0
It took a little bit to set up the system on the WiFi network but once done the quality of the system was undeniably brilliant. Well worth the purchase.,0
I love this model its so compact and nice. Good sound according to the size. It can be easily taken to on vacations and other trips. You can attach it to anything with blue tooth. I play it with my ipad and iphone and its just amazing and so convenient.,0
Absolutely the best sound....and.....this works with other MP3 players!!! Took it to the beache in Mexico and instead of everyone on their own mp3 earbuds we were able to listen to our music together!!!  What a concept!!,0
Bought this for my desk at work. Perfect size for a small work area,0
I got this back in June of 2017 when it was 50% off on the JBL website.  Good sound for its size.  I gave it to my sister for her 11th birthday in October.  She likes it,0
I bought this subwoofer about 2 weeks ago and was blown away. This sub rocks my home theater. This was money well spent. It's freaking incredible and rocks with Blu-ray movies. I highly recommend this product for the serious home theater jocks out there.,0
Got mine a couple days ago and there amazing except that when doing anything on your phone your music will skip,0
Using VM20 for left and right front as well as center speaker horizontally in front of the TV.  Really excellent quality speakers and with the black color,0
I bought this couple years agoand i only had to charge it few times and when i did it lasted a really long time,0
I bought this for myself and these are the best headphones ever. Way better than beats. Comes with noise cancellation and great quality sound.,0
Highs are good but could go on the deeper end a little more.but they are 5 and a 1/4's for a reason I suppose!!! All in all VERY decent speakers for a filler!!!,0
Good value subwoofer.  It really adds something to movie soundtracks and music.  Adds good bass depth for not a lot of money.,0
I love the headphones but only on its third use,0
As an audiophile,0
I bought this a couple of weeks ago got free shipping great price at 1999 and a very pleased with the sound and performance for such a small package,0
Stunning sound from such a small unit.  Do experiment with positioning in different rooms and places to discover the stereo sound this little beauty can produce.,0
I have had these for just over a month now and honestly can’t fault them! I’m abit gutted that they are cheaper here than US as I thought I was getting a saving but still worth every penny!,0
I bought this for my son and my other son wanted a popular brand that cost twice as much and was only wasted resistant. This was water proof and combines sound of you get two or more for a surround effect. The other didn't do that either. Sound quality was great too.,0
These are the only earphones that I've tried that don't fall out and I don't have to adjust when I run on the treadmill. The wireless capability is a plus since I don't have a long cord flying around when I run,0
This tiny speaker can fill a room without a problem and the sound itself has a really deep feeling to it. I'm impressed. I find myself using it way more than my soundtouch 30,0
this isnt really a review i just dont know what kind of wiring i should use to hook up this amazing sub! soo if anyone would like to help me out that would be great! [:,0
Just started using this over the weekend and so for really like it. Does just what I purchased it for.,0
I know this gonna sound really dumb would the light cuz ain't radiation of some sort,0
Spend at least 1 week studying technical reviews and comparison for several top models in YouTube and internet,0
I purchased the acoustic wave system II and Love it. I wish the controls were on the front rather than the top (only because I have it up high) otherwise the sound is fantastic!,0
I've recently got this for Christmas,0
I was pleasantly surprised with how great they sounded for the price. I am considering buying another pair.,0
Very happy with your product.  I have another one exactly the same but wanted to get another while you had a great sale going on!,0
It took me a while to install my sub because I'd never sone it before. After watching several videos and getting the necessary equipment ,0

Bought this three weeks ago great sound would have given 5 stars exept cannot use remote control for other stuff even though used codes bit disappointed about this as have spent so much time bose needs to look int the codes,0
Bought this speaker around November from amazon. Got it on sale for $70 and i have to say... Great Sound,0
I love them. So comfortable and easy to use. The sound is amazing and the quiet deafening. I didn’t even know they interfaced with Google assistant and Alexa. I’m very happy with my headphones. I have always been a loyal Bose customer.,0
Only been using it a few days now but it works much better than the audio chromecast I was using previously.  Sounds good and much nicer to have direct voice control instead of casting from another assistant unit.,0
Our church has been using this the L1 for over a year. Fills the room that seats 200. Easy to transport,0
Goood subs.. havent had any trouble out of these beastfull subs. i have mine runnin on an Quantum Audio 1200@ 2ohms amplifier,0

Bought for an overseas flight,0
I bought this about 2 or 3 months ago and I still use it to this day. Also the sound quality is great.,0

Just amazing. I am have been using it for the past 2-years and it is working perfectly. Worth spending your money. Also worth giving a good gift to any one,0
I bought the earphones about a month ago and so far they have been great. Perfect money quality balance. On the cons I would only say that battery is a bit weak. All and all I would definitely recommended as long as it stays under $50,0
using it for rough and daily calls with the phone and to listen to music using it like the clear sound and quality of built.,0
Just received them two days ago. They are the most comfortable headphones I have ever worn. The noise cancellation is phenomenal and the sound is wonderful. The battery lasts for a very very long time also.,0

Amazing Sound quality,0
The Mrs got me this for Christmas,0
I got this for my birthday a couple days ago,0
I have just bought an iPhone 7 Plus. My Apple advisor suggested Bose earphones. I bought Quiet Comfort 35 from Amazon. (They don't discount them.) I find the head[phones to fit perfectly. The sound quality is superb. I am v very excited about this purchase.,0
This is the best Bluetooth speaaker that I ever purchased. Small speaker with nice sound and great bass sound. I previously used the Jawbone Speaker and it was ok but this speaker is 100 times better and I will never going to replace this speaker again.,0
Sound is great! (YouTube music skips for a fraction of a second here and there but IT IS NOT THE HEADPHONES problem,0
Eeeexcellent subs,0
Bough this so I can work on my car with some tunes playing. The Xtreme exceeded my expectations. I can listen in harmony now.......,0
GREAT SOUND! I use a very old 1998 E-Machines 366i2,0
I bought this a while back ago and it's beyond its use yet it still works great.  It's def worth your money for such durable product,0
I really like this design but not very many quality available anymore in this specific design.  JBL makes a good solid set in these. I love these for conference calls on my phone. I am not into wireless headphones at all so I like these.,0
I finally traded in my old RT800's,0
Received as a Christmas gift fm my son and love it. Quality product with wonderful sound. Get yourself one!,0
Got this a few weeks ago now,0
I had the Bose soundtouch 130 before I exchanged it to the Bose soundtouch 300... The ST 300 is a better system because you can add the rear speakers and the subwoofer is much better it's a 10inch .. If you want the 5.1 sound get all three pieces.,0
Great sound for the size of it. Perfect for outdoors and sports like bike rides and stays secure on my bag.,0
I recently purchased my SoundLink at Best Buy and let's just say I refuse to trade it for anything in the world. Super easy to use with brilliant sound. The sound from this small speaker will fill an entire room and then some. I've always had Bose and will continue that trend for years to come.,0
This is the perfect Bluetooth speaker. It took about 10 seconds to set it up and the sound is outstanding. Just the right size at a great price point.,0
This is the only set I've been able to find that wont hurt my ears with long wear. My ears must be really small cause any generic kind just does not work for me. My pup chewed up my pair so I bought these as a replacement,0
Amazing!!,0
I use it while I ride my bike back and forth to work. Also while I am cooking dinner. Love the sound but I can still hear traffic and my husband!,0
I have owned these for a few months and they are phenomenal.  I accidentally dropped my set somewhere so I'm buying replacements.,0

2nd one I'm buying. However I find that when playing music and say you get an audio note on Whatsapp or video on phone,0
The product I bought was a great purchase. The JBL Extreme has great sound quality battery ,0
My first pair of cordless ear buds,0
For such a small speaker it had great sound.  Very clear/clean sound.  Easy to connect and very portable.  Overall a great product.,0
I have not found a better bookshelf for its price and i have been looking for a long time. I hooked a pair of these up to an onkyo 6.1 reciever and they sound amazing. They sound great for any type of music or movies. They blow away most other types of floorstanding speakers.,0
I have tried a number of smart speakers and this one is about the best.  I wish Amazon would allow clones to have the same features as their own Echo such as calling.,0
Use as speaker with Pandora to play oldies at local pub. Bluetooth with tv at night so wife doesn't have to listen to tv all night. Use with phone in car for hands off phone calls. Great sound,0
Following should sum up how I feel about this product: I haven't stopped listening to music since I got them (.),0
I just bought my second and third JBL Charge.  They are a fantastic product.  I learned about the JBL Connect last night and it was awesome to link the two Charge 3s together.,0
This is a great new take on the k240 legacy. Far and away the most balanced headphones available at this price point and suitable for studio and home use alike. This set of headphones is suitable for anyone in the market for accurate sound.,0
Can these mounts be used with the latest 201 and 301 speakers ? The would look great in the 4 corners of my  lounge.,0

I bought these for the gym and I'm so glad I did. They are comfortable and don't fall off while I'm exercising. The sound is very rich and booming. I'm very particular about the type of headphones I use because I like great sound. Bonus for me that they are sweat proof. I recommend these.,0
I am extremely pleased with the sound quality of this speaker. It plays loud and clear and actually has a very nice natural tonality. It is amazing for the price,0
My wife bought me a set of these for my birthday. The sound is to die for,0
Excellent buy and sounds great especially for the size that the speaker puts out a nice quality sound.,0
Everything's great about the JBL Charge. No problems,0
not sure what a master flight instructor,0
A perfect rear channel match for the RC85i.  Spacial separation and imaging is excellent.  I've replaced all my floor standing speakers with in wall and corner mounted and the sound is terrific!  Now I have room to walk around the family room.  Home theater ROCKS with all POLK speakers!,0
These headphones have fantastic bass and a great design. They are very stylish with great battery life. They are very comfortable to wear . Very easy to use and I would highly recommend them to others,0
I use these speakers with my tablet with Pandora.  When I am working out I have them plugged in. I have the volume cranked all the way up and not one bit of distortion.  I have been a JBL connoisseur since 1984 and also have a surround system and two floor tower speakers.  Nothing tops JBL!,0
Bought them 5 months ago and absolutely love them,0
I'm very happy with my speakers and the sound they put out. I have them hooked up to my onkyo 702. Polk hit a homerun in my book!!!!,0

Bought this for my parents so they could listen to music inside or outside while doing yard work. The speaker sounds great,0
I bought this for my nephew as a gift and he is extremely happy with the finishing and sound output. The bass is sufficient when compared to the size and treble is awesome.,0

I use it quite often. For indoor use it's perfect and it does well outside,0
I just got my hands on this Bose product,0
I bought these to negate the frequent chatter in the office,0

I have owned this pair for 2 years now.I have always played them loud.I currently have them biamped with Emotiva amps.I have the highs amped at 200 watts and the lows amped at 300 watts.These speakers play clean and loud.,0

I have a drawer full of wireless speakers,0
I just bought the Bose Wave system and I love it. Set up was a breeze while I had my morning coffee. Sound is beautiful. The system is small and simple but delivers outstanding sound through out. This probably sounds like a planted review but I promise you it's not!  I am very happy with it!,0
Awesome headphones for a very low price. The sound was more than what I expected. Just as good as the BEATS if not better. I am glad I bought this headphones.,0
This is a great subwoofer.  It pounds like madness even with only 300 watts going through it.  It simply reaches down and snatches the low notes.  Really nice sub.,0
I am simply amazed at the power and distortion free sound from this sub. It took me only 10 minutes at the shop to make up my mind and buy it on the spot. I spent a lot of time reviewing various subs but not satisfied me. Trust me this one really ROCKS !!! absolutely no regrets,0
My self and several dozen other vets Going through various VA programs recieved a set of the AE2i headphones,0
Just installed the speakers on the back side of my house near the spa and they sound awesome. They get real loud but I noticed that they sound awesome when they are a little low on the volume. What a great sitting in the spa and having some awesome background sounds.,0
I own a Bose SoundTouch 10 and it is a great speaker and the bass is amazing but the vocals aren’t as great as the bass. I don’t think the vocals pop like they should in some songs but in every song the bass always pops.,0
Been using these for a few weeks now and they sound great and stay in my ears. Happy with my headphones.,0
Awesome speaker with great sound! Have not had a problem with battery life or trouble connecting to a mobile device.,0

I am amazed at the quality and the volume this little speaker pumps out! I would highly recommend the Flip 4. Love it so much I bought a couple more for Christmas presents.,0
I've had my speaker for 3 weeks now and it just gets better. I'm re-discovering more and more of my music simply because it sounds so good. I wouldn't be without mine now. It definitely deserves 5 starts.,0
These are simply amazing for the price. Picked these up used from my local audiophile store. running them from my 1978 Onkyo A-7 Amp. So far the best pair of speakers that I have ever run so far clarity wise. The A-7 pumps out a REAL 65 watts per channel and these handle it with ease.,0
Amazing bass and highly accurate mids and treble. Really a terrific speaker all around. It could only be better if it was Airplay!,0
"I HAVE TO SAY THIS AMP IS ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS LESS THAN THE JL AUDIO AND SOUNDS REALLY DARN CLOSE!  ALL YOU HAVE TO DO BEFORE BUYING IT IS ASK YOURSELF IS ""SHOULD I BUY TWO?""",0
"I submitted a review yesterday titled ""Short Shelf Life"". Learned from other reviewers that if mic controls (vol up - down) get moisture in them",0
I finally made my purchase at a local Best Buy and all I got to say about this system is that sound quality is just amazing,0
I bought this item almost 3 months ago and I will never buy another pair of head phones. I love the fit and comfit. Just overall satisfied and will recommend them to everyone I talk to.,0
This subwoofer is certainly the best one I have purchased.It has really added deep bass to my system in comparison to previous one I was using.A great value with solid construction.I am very pleased with this purchase.,0
I purchased these solely for the purpose of working out. Over the few days i owned them,0
To be honest,0
I bought this recently and I love it so much! I am surprised at the quality of sound that comes from such small speaker,0
Bought this a few weeks ago and I am loving it . Hands free has a whole new meaning. It’s comfortable to wear and the sound quality is what you expect from Bose.,0
Longtime fan of JBL I love the features on the headphones. I like that the case charges the headphones. Can rock all day long would definitely recommend a friend. Thanks JBL great product,0
I've had these in my car for 6 months now. They sound super clean and crisp. there's no need for the tweeter boost on the cross over. The only thing I don't like is the lack of lower mid range. I think that's due to my doors design though,0
I must say.. it is the first time I spend so much money in headphones... but... I love them. :) the sound is clear! they are not heavy at all. And i love the fact I can control Sire on my iPhone without touching the phone. You will not regret!!!,0
Great product I bought this product a month ago. Plays amazing music without any interruption and from any device,0
For the price and the quality,0
Worthy of the Bose name with sound quality matching that of other Bose products. Reliable and clear bluetooth connection. Super easy setup out of the box. Most comfortable in-ear headphones.,0
Bought this over black Friday,0
These headphones are so comfortable,0
i tried it,0
These are so good for their price,0
Great speakers.  Perfect range with surprisingly deep lows.  Crisp highs.  Very happy with purchase.,0
These are awesome headphones!  The sound is very clear and realistic with solid bass. I was a little skeptical given some of the reviews posted here and on Amazon but I can say they are very comfortable and sound great.  If in doubt as I was,0
The SoundTouch music system was the best Christmas present ever. The sound is perfect and the system is so easy to use. I love it!,0
I received these headphones about a month ago,0
This is our second set which was purchased for my wife. Have had mine about two years. Wife is extremely pleased,0
I brought the Basslink to give my car stereo a little more punch.  Wow did it ever do the job and then some.  Simple to install and it made my little Tracker thumb.  This is the third basslink I have purchased and I would recommend to friends and family.,0
I installed 2 pair in my 2002 Mercury Mountaineer.  I replaced the factory premium speakers due to muffled sound quality.  The Polk speakers sound excellent.  They perform outstanding with the factory sub-woofer and radio.  I am very pleased with the speaker's performance.,0
I have neva bumpy so loud poot in boc and blew up swap for nu one and bumpy again now my box smells toasty,0
Bought them from Target online - just tried them - almost non existent base. Will return them and keep looking for better sport headphones.,0
I purchased my JBL flip 4 speaker two weeks ago and I absolutely love it. The sound is amazing,0
Fantastic sound! Portable. Easy to use. I can easily plug my mp3 and phone. My sister got the same and totally loved it. That is why I decided to buy one for myself. Highly recommend it.,0
I bought four speakers to cover my 40'x22' patio and installed the rubber insert in order to make the speaker water tight.,0
I listened to the music reproduced by the speaker and was impressed about the high quality sound. But i like to hear stereophon. Could You please develop speakers wich allow to select between mono,0
I bought one for me and my girlfriend,0
This is a great sounding center speaker. I have  had it matched to a a few different pairs of Polk speakers,0
Pulled the trigger on these today and haven't regretted it since. Very strong bass but not overpowering. Mids and highs are very crisp and warm.,0
Thank you for taking time to review our product. Your valuable feedback will assist other customers during the decision making process,0
The sound quality and basse quality is great you can play music so loud and clear that its not a problem to have a proper banging house party batery life got no competition compare to other portable speakers recomend to anybody who is looking to buy the best avelible portable speaker .,0
i bought this jbl a year ago in an excellent condition. but today the left woofer just broken. and i don''t know where to service it,0
Replaced my JBL-GHE-1000v i bought in 1997 with the Studio 590 - The half price sale made these affordable for me . I am very happy with the clarity and dynamic sound from them. Veey satisfied with the 590s and i would recommend them to anyone  who enjoys great sound ! Thanks JBL,0
I already bought the jbl charge for my wife(she loves it) just bought charge 3 for my mother same results! Wouldnt hesitate to buy another.,0
I bought my first wireless speaker from Bose and really enjoying the great features. Sounds is so great and volume is awesome.,0
This system is incredible,0
Bought these for my 6 year old to use on the plane. He loves them,0
An excellent product,0
I bought this speaker several months ago I love it I turn it on just to hear it,0
i have used the old ones ,0
Tangle free cable,0
My granddaughter is very happy with her new Inspire 200. The magnets keep it from tangling up. The color goes with her phone case. And it does not fall out of the ear. Thank you and Jesus loves you,0
"I got these today at lunch. They are AWESOME! They do everything they say they do! It blocked out my husband talking and the ball game at 35 + on the tv volume. When I turned the aware ""off"" I barely heard a thing!Thank you BOSE! Awesome!",0
This wireless speaker is my favorite the sound that comes out sounds is perfect and the bass is like what they say you hear it you see it .compared to other that cost more and sound cheap !. buy one and you see what I mean very pleased..,0
Great sound in a very compact package. Good connectivity from phone and iPad,0
This is a really great product. I love the size,0
While shopping for a home theater speakers package,0
In my family we have multiple devices. My wife has an iHome,0
I had a second thought of buying this,0
I bought it in sale of Memorial day . I am pretty happy with the quality of sound at the rate i got it ($30.0) ,0
What a fantastic buy! The sounds is incredible,0
These headphones are VERY comfortable.  It's unbelievable how much outside noise is eliminated once you turn them on.  I purchased them to use for frequent travel but find myself using them at home to listen to music due to the clarity and comfort.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend these.,0
This is my 2nd Mini. I bought this one because I can charge USB.  The music is crystal clear,0
"I've got a pair of these in my car with an MTX 404 on them and with company from 2 of polks 2124 12"" subs i would have to say that my system rocks. Hard bass",0
Very good sound for its size.   Excellent build quality.   I love the fact that it's waterproof.   Just what I have come to expect from JBL.,0
I wanted something I could carry around with good sound and this did the trick I love it would highly recommend it,0
I love this speaker the only thing that boathers me is that the clip itself is wierd.I dont know if its just a malfunction or something on my speaker put the little pin keeps poping out i dont know why but everything else is perfect,0
Had these for over 5 yrs they are without doubt the best set of speakers Iv ever had.  I rigged up a Bluetooth adaptor to the Jack plug.  Tip top sound but needs updating with Bluetooth or wifi.  Also the volume bezel rubber ring perishes after a few yrs rubber goes sticky not very nice.,0
Saw it at a friends wedding and ordered my own,0
I bought this about a year ago.  Every time I travel/go somewhere,0
This is my first bose product and it is awesome. But it would be better if this comes in more colours.,0
I love how small this speaker is and that it's portable....great to use when I am in the shower because it's waterproof too!,0
I think the sound quality is great. And I'm honestly surprised how much bass it has. I took it camping with me and forgot the charger and it literally lasted the whole weekend.,0
Best headphones I've used so far ! I was looking for headphones which will not be to big and with a good sound quality. I think the K518 is the perfect match. A great & sober design,0
My boyfriend bought this for me yesterday and I love it clean clear crisp sound and does not bog down when u have a song on with a lot of bass,0
I have a pair of RTi A9s connected to my computer. I use them for listening to music,0
Absolutely love this! We are short on space and so no room for a larger system with sub woofer. The Bose solo II is awesome on its own!,0
i picked these up for my 06 mazda6 ... Got them for 100 for both pairs on sale... huge deal.. put them in and got them amped.. sound quality is great,0
Bluetooth headphones dom JBL is great but add on the heart rate monitor and link it with under armour and you've got something amazing.   Very satisfied with my purchase,0
I use this speaker daily. I have owned about two months and I am very glad I bought it. JBL has been very easy to deal with. I most certainly recommend JBL.,0
I got a pair of the JBL Duet NC's when I got my brand new Samsung Galaxy Note 9 and I think I love these more then the phone itself like the look and feel of them is insane and the quality is just amazing.,0
I gave this as a gift to a friend and they can not stop talking about how great it is to have at the pool while she is laying out!  She loves the sound quality and the volume!,0
Yarmaine Here,0
I left my JBL Reflect buds in my sweat pants. My wife washed them. They went through a full wash cycle and a full dry cycle and they still work perfectly. I don't recommend this as a thing to do but I am amazed that they still work perfectly. Great Job JBL!!!!!,0
I like the build quality,0
I bought these sunglasses in San Francisco and use them everyday cycling in Ireland. Very good job done by Bose.,0
I've just bought these with the F1 subs and wow they are the best what can I say Bose have done it again. I've come from using Bose 802 to these 812 and love them thank you for making the sound so clear,0
love these little speakers with a big sound they fit in your pant pockets and can answer calls and are clear with a push of a button i have three now and thank the jbl team for such an amazing little speaker   THANK YOU!!!!,0
i just everyone to know that these speakers are the best i ever came across. you guys out there who like to speand money on bose speakers needs to listen to polk speakers,0
Bought the Bose Solo 5 for my desk. Reading the reviews,0
I have a problem that there are no themes I can choose as described in quick start guide. The version of the app is v2.4. Anyone can help me?  BTW,0
Im happy i bought this clip cause i go hiking alot and omg it sounds wonderful. Dont have to through the hassle of a sweaty phone. So im super glad i bought this!,0
got it 2 days ago and its incredible,0
Just got it .Sound is Amazing. Absolutely stunning high quality sound from Bose Definitely! The best..,0
This product is perfect for the pool. Or on foot. Or anywhere you want and don't need electricity. Long lasting battery produces hours of clear and powerful sound!,0
Just bought this speaker from the local Bose store today and I have to say this speaker is top notch. The sound is so clean at any volume. Its loud and smooth. Better than any other bluetooth speaker I've heard. Just go and buy it already.,0
I'm not an ear buds kinda guy but I got a set for Christmas and wow are these awesome I love these so much..I use them at work and when mowing the lawn. Now I only wish the battery lasted as long as my android..lol,0
This wireless system is flawless and it a great buy for the money! I would highly recommend this system because it performs like none other.,0
I have bought this ,0
Just arrived and managed to convert my amp to work on my Bose system. Saved a lot of money and couldn't be more pleased,0
My first Bose setup and I absolutely love it. Sound is incredible for music,0
I bought 3 sets of headphones for the family,0
I thought these were going to be weak headphones especially for the price but when I got them they have good bass and sound quality also not as heavy as I expected great for the pricing and all around a good product,0
I bought a 2nd wireless adapter from Bose to expand out my music to my entire house. Easy installtaion,0
All around an awesome product! Great sound,0
Love my families JBL flip! Fun for the pool parties and easy to take anywhere ! Great compact speaker,0
I bought one for myself when I heard and saw the colors at a retail store. The sound could be heard throughout the store!!! Loved it so much bought one for my son. He is going to buy a second one!!!,0
I love Bose stuff. Have headphones,0
I bought the JBL Go first but needed something for biking,0
I got these and I loved them ! I use them when I'm working out I think everybody should get these ((:,0
I purchased this about 3 weeks and love it. The sound quality is great and the colors are beautiful. This my first time purchasing from JBL and I'm impressed. This is perfect for outings at the park or just hanging out with your friends and family. You'll love it!,0
I bought this sometime ago. It's played daily and I have to say is like having the performers in your room. BRILLIANT!,0
I bought this recently and it is totally worth the price!!!! It sounds amazing and can go very loud. I love it and am very happy with it.,0
"I purchased this item 3 months back and absolutely love them. Could not believe they were ""factory renewed"". Great item and the price was outstanding. An item to try if you are not ready for a larger investment in the Bose QC line.",0
I purchased two of the JBL Flip 2 speakers (1 for me and the other as a gift) and we were amazed with the sound this portable speaker produces. I definitely recommend this product.,0
I loved these and already did a review. I contacted the company regarding the warranty and they sent me a replacement!,0
Just switched from the Beats Solo2 Wireless to these and I am in love! The around ear style made a huge difference for me,0
For pure quality sound and ultimate comfort,0
I got these because they were supposed to fit well and they do! Very secure fit and the case has so much backup power it works great. The only issue I have is that there is no way to use only the left earpiece. It's the right side or both. I don't mind it but it would be a nice feature.,0
This subwoofer sounds so good. It has bass that isn't so heavy that you cant stand it its just clear bass. You can feel it in the floor and it was really easy to set it up with the soundbar. Everything worked so well in the app.,0
Always and an unknown when it comes to buying anything without having the luxury of trying them out. In this case I was really pleased to “hear” the quality of these ear buds! Love them.   I’d buy more tomorrow,0
"4xfggv  <a href=""http://qfwquibrxcqc.com/"">qfwquibrxcqc</a>",0
Excellent product,0
I bought this a week ago the sound and quality of this JBL flip 4 is  amazing !  Would highly recommend !,0
Tried the cs250's and found them to be no better. This is where my Polk system started. These speakers are fine if you add some volume to the centre channel and send the bass to some big floor standing speakers.,0
I bought my QuietComfort 35s 4 months ago and so far its been great. The noise cancelling is out of this world.,0
I bought it a month before I really liked it battery life and comfort but I think they should design in a way that it could connect more than 2 devices,0
Great for small rooms or those who wish to add just a bit of kick to their system.  The sleek finish goes well in most rooms.,0
This is a great choice for the living room ! When I watch tv I don't always use my 7.1 surround system  And my tv speaker blew so I got this and I can't believe the sound it's really impressive and you can blue tooth to it really nice ,0
Really happy with my headphones... also,0
I absolutely love this speaker. I wish they would have come up with a case for it and a App. with an equalizer. Also,0
I needed some everyday speakers. Almost bought the charge but hear the charge 2 was coming. I waited and happy I did.,0
Saw these were top rated online and fit well and thought I'd try. These fit so well and stay in my ear! They also block more background noise then the typical buds supplied with phones.,0
Just got it. Sound quality is average but the build quality is really good. You should buy it on sale because I don't think it is worth 60CAD or 40USD,0
I have three of these subs,0
I purchased this about 6 months ago to use with my iPhone,0
I love my speaker it such a treasure to have in the home I can take it with me through out the house and at the job it's so convenient to have and the sound is great.,0
This headphone make you fully sink into the music and focus on that. Good EQ setup on the headphone and you can enjoy your own music anytime in anywhere,0
I have two with CD players and my latest is without. I've never experienced any of the issues I've read regarding the CD player,0
Did a lot of research on it before I purchased this product before my spring semester started and I don’t regret it at all. Amazing speaker for its price. Bass hits well,0
Bought these for when I'm on the airplane. Just in case of no Bluetooth rule. Comes with nice caring case.,0
I was skeptical when I bought it. I got it on a very good deal. You would love the bass and sound quality. Excellent product and very good premium sound headphones. Definitely a buy.,0
great sound and feel. best i ever tried. mode select is a little confusing not know what mode you are in,0
My parents bought me this and I was crying when I saw it. But when I heard it,0
great sound also great dongle for volume and etc:: felt like i was not wearing them  they are very stylish and made really great i cannot fault them,0
Really good subwoofer for the price. I bought one for a single box i had. Was convinced and really enjoyed the quality so i bought another two.,0
I have heard many really good speakers and even occasionally make my own,0
"F4sv1t  <a href=""http://nenbxfueqwle.com/"">nenbxfueqwle</a>",0
Been looking at these for a while and I ordered this just after Christmas. Delivered yesterday and was a sinch to setup. The sound is amazing and I can't wait to add further speakers.,0
Great sound quality and excellent design. Would love to have little bigger version of this with improved battery life  up to 15 hours and more louder with waterproof design in Bose SoundLink Mini III,0
I was skeptical due to the price but the quality of sound is awesome. Just bought my second soundtouch.,0
cos i felt my ipad speak is very weak,0
Looks and sounds good.  Two issues- the letters on the remote are hard to read in dim light and Alexa only controls volume and on/off.  Better if it can switch between music,0
These subs rocked my el camino,0
It's always good to have extras of these and I think they work well. Both the StayHear Ultra headset and these StayHear Ultra tips are great! Only problem is they only sent me one pair,0
When i bought it ,0
i like the design and was able to set up and understand controls with out owners manual. sound quailty is good much better than the i phone speaker. would buy again.,0
The sound is amazing. This is my third shot at something for cool sound. Nothing else is close. I would buy again. It sounds like your there.,0
I got the Extreme for half off during Black Friday Week. My cheerleader daughter took it on the team bus after we won the football state championship and said it rocked. “We are the champions... Of the state!”,0
Doesnt work I bought this 1 day ago,0
Jesus Christ im still shaking.This sub is amazing and my companion has become jealous because I have a new love.The Subwoofer.,0
Phenomenal bass from this sub-woofer,0
I got these around 7 months ago from amazon india . Very happy that i did. Its a bit expensive but for the sound and the comfort that it provides ,0
Except the foam gum sleeves. Mine those sleeves goes broken. Actually,0
I have the wireless one Bose headphones I just ordered the new wireless 2 headphones in the headphones can hear your text messages from your iPhone when u r hook up iPad as well thank u,0
This is the quality product that I expected to receive from Bose! Easy to use with exceptional sound quality.,0
This headphones are the best thing of my day,0
I've had mine hooked up in a 5th wheel,0
When taking or making calls you only get sound from right bud making it hard to hear the person talking need stereo not mono. Please fix!!!!,0
The sound quality is a lot better than the JBL Charge 3. At low volume and high volume,0
These are the finest speakers I've had on my computer,0
"Mind blowing sound for 4 6.5"" drivers. Exceptional low end for no large drivers Just plain pretty to look at",0
I got these for my wife for our anniversary. She loves them. Easy to use at the gym,0
I've been a Bose person for decades and the signature sound that Bose is known for always delivers. Plan on purchasing the Bass speaker next to compliment the already rich tone of the Soundbar 500 and add even more punch and deep bottom,0
My first Bose purchase and I was not disappointed. Room-filling wide soundstage with good low-notes production from compact speakers. I would definitely recommend them to anybody in this price bracket.,0
"I have had these ""buds"" for a while and they work well for me. They fit well and sound quality is just fine.",0
i had never herd of the brand jbl before i got given a pair and wow they sound just as good as my $ 2,0
I bought this speaker 3 weeks ago and  absolutely love it. I use it at and in the pool. I travel for work and bring it with me to pair with my tablet for watching Netflix. Ready to buy a second one to pair them together for real stereo sound.,0
Soft,0
For work. I'm a electrical engineer and I would love safety glasses that are clear so I can work . And list to music you if. You can 5*,0
The says it all... simply the best. .. I cant wait to take them to the shooting range,0
Overall in my opinion,0
I purchased this 4 days ago at best buy and i cant love it more! Im going to take it to a different country and party everyday hahah the sound is great,0
I received these headphones as a gift and its the best headphones I ever tried. Now I have everything with Bose. I initially thought the white would be very easy to dirty,0
Wow!  this is one mean center channel speaker it goes well with my 51 inch tv makes my home theater look what a surround sytem should look aggresive. and for the sound it goes well with my 8oois and 300is surround speakers,0
I love this earphones but mostly the customer service that Bose employees provide when dealing with a warranty issue.,0
I thought after reading through the reviews I was going to have a problem with the zipper.  Either they changed the design or I got lucky,0
The speaker works great after I figured out how to connect to my devices. I would give 5 stars if it had better instructions on how to operate it.,0
ordered this three days before Christmas and received it on Christmas Eve. How's that for service? This product lives up to all the hype,0
I bought this along with a surround sound system and it works perfectly I would recommend it to anybody 10/10,0
I bought this because I am a lift operator. The sound is good and can be heard over the hum of the lift. Bass is decent,0
I love them,0
I really enjoy using these headphones,0
"I treated myself for Father's Day...I have another wireless device it's good but this thing is ""AWESOME"" I love the light display....JBL struck GOLD with this one...",0
slick,0
just received these and they are brilliant. Bought JBL on the recommendation of my husband,0
Picked up for $120 at JBL site on sale. Great sound and love the color of grill. Could not justify purchase if,0
I got this a month ago and this is honestly the best bluetooth speaker for the money you can buy. From Stevie Wonder's Superstition to Drake's 0 to 100,0
Pros: First experience with JBL. Very present sound and rich defined basses (very on the edge but defined). Cons: the cable transmits the vibration a lot to the ears and the microphone is very sensitive to touch with clothes or zips.,0
For the price of this mic you really cant go wrong. It is an awesome mic with great performance. You do get some background noise / interference but it is not noticeable at all unless you really amp up the sound.,0
I bought this for my hubby who is really particular about electronics and he loves it. It has great sound and he likes that it can stand as well as lay down. It's easy yo use,0
i bought this on amazon couple month ago. pretty satisfy so far. however,0
Bought for daughter's birthday over a week ago and she loves it.  Great sound,0
"Hello Brothers! <a href=""http://shortlink.co.uk/d4u#phentermine?1adv=1"">cheap phentermine</a> [url=http://shortlink.co.uk/d4u#phentermine?1adv=2]cheap phentermine[/url] http://shortlink.co.uk/d4u#phentermine?1adv=3",0
I bought this a year ago and i love it!!! I have used it everywhere I go. I got rid of my stereo and preferred this instead. Better sound quality!!,0
I have had a pair of these speakers for about four years. With the recent purchase of some LSi25's,0
Got them for Christmas to use with my iMac computer.  They will not connect with a computer.  They will connect with my iPhone and iPad.  I have ear buds them because I don't want to lug around a large pair of ear phones. I am trying to find out if I can buy another type of connecter.,0
Does exactly what it says. Just with it had a better battery. As an audio expert I would give the quality 4/5. The bass is fantastic!,0
Bought as a family gift for xmas and waited to review. The little guy is better than I had hoped and well worth the price.  Will be nabbing a second one,0
"I bought the tsx550t towers the tsx250c and two sets of tsx220 as well as four polk 12"" subs (psw505) running off a Yamaha rxv773. It sounds unbelievable. I listened to a lot of brands be for I bought and you can not touch this polk setup without spending twice as much.",0
Sound quality is so good it’s unbelievable,0
Great headphones for working out in. Theses are the only headphones that will stay in my ears when running and jumping.,0
Works really well,0
Wow JBL,0
I love the sound quality and they feel good in the ear but dont buy unless you want people hearing what your listening too,0
Excellent sound,0
Can't work properly with Google Home. Goes off into sleep mode every 30 minutes when idle. Have always need to turn on manually. Frustrating. Will swap to another brand. Other than that is very good.,0
Good basic headphones at this price. Sound quality is very good and controls are simple to operate. No problems with connecting to my Apple devices. These are on ear phones and get a little uncomfortable after long periods. I’m happy with this purchase.,0
Best 4x6's I sampled in my long hunt for my ideal car stereo setup.  The highs are piercing,0
this sub is awsome,0
Family owns a few of these speakers.   Finally bought mine at a great price.  The sound is great and battery life is excellent.   Love it!,0
I bought this about 5 months ago. It is great sound for gaming and videos. I enjoy using the bluetooth function on it with my iPhone. I would definitely recommend this for family or friends.,0
I bought this a month ago it definitely beats having something in your ear at work for 8 hrs,0
i recently installed these in my car running off a profile california amplifier at 80w rms. after playing them for a while,0
I have 4 JBL L-80ti from the 80' but now,0
Has to be one of the best subwoofer bargains on the market. Powerful! Polk Audio just flat out makes great stuff!,0
I am so,0
Bought 2 pair a few weeks ago,0
I didn't expect the sound to be so clean and tight,0
These speakers are the best in their class and price range. These speakers look beautiful in your living room.,0
I ordered this product and i could not wait to get it...it was backordered and now i know why...this is an amazing improvement on my TV sound...easy setup and no issues,0
We are boat manufacture and adopting your product for years. Customers are impressed by your product and good feedback.,0
This is one of the best-looking subs you can buy at this price range,0
I received the Quietcomfort 35 as a Christmas gift and they are Bose's best headphones yet in my humble opinion. Bluetooth pairing was seamless and the sound was fantastic! I downloaded the Bose Comfort app - what a terrific new feature! I highly recemmend this product!,0
I bought this speaker for fathers day and we used it this past weekend. It is very loud and powerful. Everyone at our gathering was like what a cool speaker!,0
Easy set up and great sound. Only critisism is with the Internet Radio keeps dropping out ' Very Frustrating ' not acceptable on this level of quality product Bose.,0
Bought two of these for Christmas gifts. My young adult children really enjoy them and think the sound is very good. I chose these over the other very good brand because it can charge their phone.,0
I just bought my second pair.  I like the corded version,0
I don't know how we would get through the day without this. We take turns to link up our favourite playlists and are able to enjoy great quality audio all day long. Love it! Pricey,0
I have nuthing but love for my polk audio momos. They hit louder then any sub i have put them against.  They look sweet also. I have 2 sitting in my trunk run by a sony 1000watt xplod amp.,0
Bought the JBL On Stage Micro on sale from the jbl.com site for under $30 and glad that I did.  it plays my iPod Nano (6th Gen) with a few of the buttons on the remote,0
I got these little gems a few weeks ago and I love them. I'm not used to wearing them and the sound quality is right on point. I especially love them for working out and even talking on the phone. They are a little pricey but worth the money.,0
I love my Flip 4 it has been a great speaker so far.  We enjoyed Ken Burns Vietnam on it intense sound. It seems to handle all my music and links up easy.,0
I have to say this is only my second JBL speaker but I am not disappointed at all. The sound quality is rich and smooth and the bass is crazy! I have used JBL connect with my pulse 3 and it just enhances the experience even more! Be sure to go grab one! JBL Boombox is dope period!,0
I love themWould recommend them to all my friend I also have a second pair of bose had those for four ears,0
This are my first BT headphones and I just love them! The sound quality is awesome and the controls are great,0

Sounds amazing very nice so happy thanks bose so happy I bought them I have the air pods as well but bose are better. But they stick out a bit I like the sound one bose but not in ear but are still very good with them,0
I am quite a newbie in the home audio world.  I read good reviews about these Polk speakers and I am not disapointed.  The sound is very clear and nice with my Denon receiver.  I will soon add two more Polk bookshelf speakers to complete my 7.1 setup.,0
Bought this speaker used off eBay in 2004 to complement my LS90's and LSfX surrounds. Match's well and has provided years of quality entertainment.,0
I have aways known about these speakers for year but today I got tem for my Macbook Pro 2016 Touchbar setup and I must say. I do love them.,0
Excellent product for the price. I mostly purchased them for gym usage and they have proved durable enough to withstand a slight beating.,0
Just bought a pair and i love them so far. Working out in them was great,0
Bought for use on pool deck. Sound is great,0
I received a set a year ago. Let my daughter use them and now I purchased a set for her for this holiday,0
Finally earbuds that not only allow me to comfortably IMMERSE myself in the music,0
I had been looking for a portable speaker to carry with me to the beach and nothing ever seemed durable enough or high quality. With my JBL Charge 3 I get high quality sound with durability AND a nice,0
Ive had these for about a month and am fairly happy with them. A better selection of sounds would be nice. They fit well and stay in place. They do a decent job of blocking outside noise (cough,0
s very impressed! Small speaker but huge sound. It is a great speaker I am thinking about getting the charge or flip for even more Soud,0
Buy the model JBLCHARGE3SQUADAM and has a separation of the cover in the union of the bottom part,0
Perfect headphones for any lifestyle.  You don't have to worry about constantly adjusting them because they fit perfectly and stay in place. I would recommend this product to anybody.,0
"I bought 2 JBL GTO S3 1024 10"" subs",0
Its like hitting the jackpot for this purchase,0
Awesome,0
My boyfriend gave this to me as a gift about two years ago,0
This speaker is the best investment! The sound is super crisp and the bass is so deep. Amazing over all!!,0
Got this a few ago,0
so i would never spend this much money on a speaker,0
Great sound and really easy to use. The mobile app is complex but pretty cool to play around with and adjust the sound. They are comfortable and light and are the best headphones I have ever had,0
I bought these for my sport ear buds to replace the ones that come with them they are a HUGE improvement on the originals and should come with every pair of Bose ear buds.,0
If I had two more ears I would order another set wow think my puppy wants a set two my wife likes to watch tv at night and there horror story’s not scared any more from the screams thanks ulysses,0
I picked up this system around the holidays. It was a screaming deal and great value. Setup was easy as can be. I paired this with a Denon receiver and went through the automatic setup process. My wife now asks me what that sound is only to find out that it's the surround speakers.,0
Great sound quality,0
I have the earphones for about a month. At first I was a bit worried about the neckband but the sound makes it all worth it. I have the QC20 and the sound is about the same but the wireless is a big plus.,0
I got my revolve a couple of months ago and I love it! Best portable speaker I've ever had. I took it with me on holidays to Bali,0
These things are life savers on airplanes and the NYC subway. They cut down on so much background noise,0
I have been using my little hockey puck (as I call it) for many months now when I go biking. It has good sound,0
Turn these sleepbuds into earbuds and they could really challenge for the airpods' throne. Great fit,0
I was using the David Clarks great headset. However,0
Only had this a couple weeks. Really like the loudness and sound quality. Perfect for what I need it for. Hopefully get to use it a bit more over summer.,0
Bought five and gave them to each of my kids (adults) for Christmas.   Each one has thanked me and told me how great this device has been for them.  One taks it to work and the entire office enjoys music because of it.  Score!,0
I was to suprice with firts connection,0
My wife loves the wave soundtouch I bought her. I had bought a soundtouch just a month before and it sits in my rec room. Only question,0
I've had my headset for about 4 months and I treat them like gold. I know they're built to last,0
I don't know why it took me so long to look at Bose for my computer speakers - I have Bose products throughout my house. But I can tell you,0
Perfect for the price.  I use these under an overhang for outdoor speakers - facing due north,0
My family has owned these speakers for quite a while and we've fallen in love with it. The sound is amazing and we've received many comments on how spectacular the sound quality is.,0
I love the flip 3 and it is best by far in clearity and quality for any speaker I've bought. I also love the external radiators,0
Am shocked that so many are having issues with zipper or phantom power on while in box. I've had mine for 8 months and used daily with no issues! Love it...,0
I bought this product about 3 months ago and i love it! It sounds good in every area except bass. Bass was not as good as i expected but you can turn it up a little which makes a small difference. So over all a good product!,0
I bought this one month ago and I'm very happy with it I was surprised at the quality of the sound and the battery life the battery life last longer than the music I was playing on my iPad Air 2,0
Fantastic sound,0
This product is amazing with beautiful sound quality,0
Wanted something somewhat decent to replace the useless Bluetooth speaker I bough5 last year. This little speaker is perfect for enhancing the weaker volume of my iPad.,0
Just received this for Christmas from my wife. Charged it,0
I bought this a month ago speaker sound is awesome,0
I bought my Colorlink about 5 months ago - I cannot imagine being without it now. I travel a lot and the first thing I do when I get to the hotel room is unpack my Colorlink to play some of my favourite music. It is simply brilliant,0
I owned several Bose headphones in the past. Just recently,0
Had done my researched before but it pales when I actually went out and test the Flip 3,0
Great system! Hands down better then any other surround system out there. After trying one movie,0
The sound quality is amazing and it was so easy to set up. Also,0
Just purchased these rm-10's from Polk Audio refurbished. They sound great by themselves but even unbelievable with the Polk Audio DSW Pro 500. I like listening to music and they just scream clarity.,0
This home theater has it all for its price,0
This is the perfect party speaker.  Because of it's durability and great sound we are   going to buy a second one. We use it poolside all the time,0
This is an amazing piece of kit. The sound is out of this world & it looks great under the t.v. So easy to set up & I would recommend this to everyone. Thank you Bose,0
I got my 1st JBL headphone(JBL Tempo) with MIcromax A88(Canvas Music)....the sound clarity is awesome...and soothing to the ears even when I turn the volume up... I recommend this product to all music lovers...,0
its been about 2 weeks and so far im loving them. they are helping me sleep with all the noise around me. only thing i would recommend for next time is to make the part that touches the pillow out of a different material when i rubs on the pillow it makes an annoying noise,0
Been postponing buying this and I don’t know why I love it so much. The sound quality is great for the price especially since I got it on sale. I got the white and in person it’s a little more gray than I would have liked but still very nice.,0
I bought this to replace an older JBL Xtreme that I had for years.  I've had this speaker for about a month,0
I bought this speaker after trying many others before this. This one by far is the best! Best sound and base combo on the market as far as I am concerned.,0
Very good speaker. The size will surprise you with good clear quality sound. For the size,0
Just bought JBL Flip 4. Great Sound,0
Purchased this for a trip.  Works great at normal volumes.  At low volumes it shuts off after a min or two.  Work around is to cable it and and turn off Bluetooth.,0
I have a few other JBL speakers and was thinking of adding another one to my collection when I saw this one on sale right before Christmas. I am glad I did. I bought a refurb one and it looks brand new. Now connect it to my other JBL and the sound is real nice.,0
have recently bought this ..... and am so glad. matching it with my TSI300 floorstand speaker .... it gives a perfect blend   Dialog clarity was good ...... movies and xbox sounds comes out so alive   highly recommended,0
Brought two,0
Sounds great,0
The sound is great I couldnt be more happy. Love the build quality too. But I purchased this to be portable speakers while hiking and camping with that being said where is this case?? I noticed the Flip came with a very nice neoprene form fitting case. Why no case on the Charge 2??,0
The best headphones. You only have to buy the jbls to get quality sound. The Bluetooth makes them easy. I love my jbls headphones! 1,0
Best sound love it. Really a great sound and nice looking. Just wish the case held the charger. That is not very convenient not being able to .,0
BIG BASS I LOVEM. In search of the perfect speakers at a good price i found these babys i highly recomend for serious sound and bass.,0
I have not had music in the house for 10 years. Gave up TV also. Keeping the music,0
So I’ve been wanting these for awhile and was lucky enough to catch them on sale! Had a little bit of trouble with initial set up,0
Great quality headphones- amazing sound quality,0
I have the 12's up front,0
Was given a pair of these by my son for Christmas,0
Is it possible to connect sound/music from external flash drive on this unit? If so,0
I've been so hesitant about trying another pair of wireless headphones,0
Speaker sounds great and the battery lasts forever! I played this speaker around 33% max volume on a weekend camping trip,0
I bought them a week ago,0
The best in the world! I enjoyed very much the headphones and the deep bass sound and heard on,0
I bought my wave system a month or so ago and am glad I did when I did.  The system was easy to set up and it amazes me the different places you can operate the system from (ie. Laptop,0
Excellent sound,0
Ok so I own 4 of these pulse 2 speakers. They're amazing!  Great sound and very durable.  Just one question tho.  Are they just regular connect or are they connect+?,0
Love my revolve. Nothing better than sitting on my balcony listening to great music.  Don't need anything else except a beer.  Thanks heaps Bose,0
I have gotten many different pairs of ear buds and I have to say that these are the first ones to actually stay in my ears. They take a little getting use to ,0
I purchased from Oman Extra showroom and it is best in the class and feel like I am in theater. Also in price range.,0
Have owned for about a month easy to use sounds great all function work no problems thanks Harmon Kardon for another great product best price on the web,0
Very happy but pleaaaaase make a thing that go down to 50HZ something like this,0
This is one of the best purchase I have made in many years. I've been able to sleep through the night without being awaken by my husband's snoring. I would give five starts if the application allowed  more than 5 sounds to be down loaded.,0
Lasted roughly 5 years of light use,0
Purchased at Christmas I thought it was to expensive but my wife was insistant .It is brilliant and well worth the money.I would not buy another make the sound is brilliant.,0
This may be my best online purchase of the year. Smokin' product,0
I have had my Bose 1V music system for a few months and I love it. I have 24 SD cards full of music and talking books and would have liked an SD slot on my BOSE WAVE sound touch system but may be BOSE will consider a SLOT on their NEXT UPDATE.,0
Great sub,0
These headphones have changed everything I hear because they are so clear and I am never going to buy speakers or headphones from any other company other than Bose,0
Reggae never sounded so great (wicked sounds). My set up includes,0
I used jbl for decades and there speakers clarity and quality continues on there headphones this thing puts out clear quality sound I love it,0
This is the best invesment ever...ppl get in my car and are blown away...Once u hear the sr6500 and u go back to ur car and turn it up please explain to me how u survive w/o them!!,0
I bought this for myself as an early Christmas gift. The sound is fantastic for such a small device too. I bought the red one.,0
Bought this a few weeks ago,0
Very comfortable with a natural rich sound,0
Don't let my review fool you just because I left off one star. This unit is ready willing and able to go to 5.1 but until XM makes that happen then that is a part of the capability of this unit that is not being tested. Therefore,0
We use it in local radio station. It's lightweight and extremely comfortable. Headphones is used for studio guests. We have 2 of it. Sound quality is not for studio work,0
i dont have this polk momo but thinking about getting this one. i have the older one that handles 1000watts rms 500. i had problems with the older polk momo. so i am investing in this one to see how it works.,0
bought theses about a month ago were them at work all the time cant loose them,0
The sound on this sound bar is so amazing you will think that your at the concert or that you maybe in the movie! I have never heard anything like it! It is well worth the money.,0
Love everything about this headset! I do wish music could be blue toothed,0
I bought this for my son's birthday. Excellent sound for size and price. Easy to use. Would recommend,0
Bought straight from JBL,0
This speaker is so great my friend and I use to share I I like that nice deep bass but one problem I it sometimes struggles with massive bass at several occasional but besides that it sounds real great,0
I bought this a year ago and still works amazing it is very loud. It's Bluetooth accessible and it's very durable I have dropped it a lot and it's never broke,0
I like just about everything about these earbuds. I like the clean sound and solid bass.  Bonus,0
I bought this a month ago and it has very strong bass. I consider them noise cancellation headphones cause I can’t hear people with them,0
I lost my earbuds and needed a replacement for my ear phones. The fir perfect and I love the color. Thanks JBL,0
I have them for almost 3 months now and they have worked great. They are comfortable,0
I own many Bose Products and have been happy with them all. The only issue I have with the Solo unit is that the Universal Remote does not work that well with my remote Direct TV receiver.,0
I bought these headphones a week ago I love them bass is great sound is clear best headphones I bought so far,0
Bought this for my shop,0
I bought the entire setup with the Bass Module and the Rear Speakers. Absolutely incredible. Crystal clear sound,0
The sound is rich with the bass working out great. The battery lasts and it doesn't take too much time to charge. I do not think you can get something better right now with that money. Generally,0
I got these for Christmas and I love the noise cancelling because I hate listening to my brother complain al the time.,0
Best for vocal song and party song. Work well with gaming and movie as well.  Just the treble performance a little bit weaker,0
Superb headphones,0
Just picked these up today and my first impression is.... Wow,0
Great sound.  Couldn't ask for a better centre speaker.  I will be getting the M50s next to go with it.,0
I can't believe how good such a compact bar can sound! This is great when you're tight on space. Perfect addition to my system!,0
"I used to have a pair of beats and when I changed over to a pair of Bose QuietComfort 35 I realized how bad the beats were! These headphones have changes my life to better by helping me silence off my problems by just putting the CQ 35""s on.",0
I bought the Lifestyle 650 system about six weeks ago and added a second Acoustimass 300 subwoofer. The system had a highly automated set-up that made it a breeze to bring it to operation and without a hitch! The sound quality from such a slimline and elegant system is phenomenal!,0
The sound is great and have quality,0
Best sounding speaker on the market. I wish it had more bells and whistles but at $50 off I couldn't resist being a Pats fan in Virginia. Now I have a portable speaker that can fill a stadium during practice with the kids.,0
Good sound for low price. if there is a noise cancellation it will be good.   Size looks big. if we have given USB to 2.5 mm for both listening songs and charging from laptop then it's awesome. totally good.,0
The best noise cancelling headphone that I owned so far,0
I just purchased  this Bose Solo 5 for the bedroom and its perfect,0
I love the nice rich sound. It keeps its charge for a long time. I brought one for my wife and best friend also.,0
Bought them for a trip 2 years ago. Only just now having any problems and it's just I'm hard on my stuff also i've worn them almost everyday for like 6 hrs each day. The ear cushions need replaced  and the switch failed.,0
I fly for a living. I wouldn't use any other headset. And Bose Aviation customer service and support is best of the best. For something that is used so much,0
Xmas gift for my 10 year old grandson. He loves that they won't fall out of his ear while playing. He loves the magnets in the earpieces that makes them tangle resistant. He says the sound is great. Likes the case too.,0
I use it everyday when I work out. These headphones are super and I use them while I watch ESPN during my workout.,0
Will make a great Xmass gift for my 12 year old boy to connect to his laptop,0
the best ultra portable BT speakers i have. At this price range,0
I use the duet when I'm relaxing. The sound is breath taking! The clarity is stunning. The mix of high and low are well balanced. The phones are as comfortable as my favorite pillow.Great value!,0
I have several pairs of bose head phones and these in ear noise cancelling are the best,0
This product is excellent. The sound quality is very similar to the over the ear,0
I bought these for my kids for stocking stuffers and they really liked them ... caught them on a great sale and got myself a pair and really like them ... great sound,0
This speaker is amazing.   Next to the 901's,0
I was experimenting for a while with several subwoofers (other brands & costing much more) for my 7.1 Polk RM6700 based system. Finally bit the bullet and went with the PSW303. Am very pleased with the results! It sounds great and sounds very nice as well! I am now a confirmed Polk Audio fan!,0
First set of heads phones that fit and not too big,0
Amazing product....... looks and sounds great. best way to get sound without all the wires for a 5.1 system.,0
It has great bass and is very loud. I love all the different features that it has (e.g. charges mobile device,0
Love this case. Took a week after I purchased to discover the inside mesh pocket which makes it even more easier to keep them from getting tangled. The case is made with durability and quality in mind.,0
The speaker is very good BUT that hissing noise in low volume level made me very upset. It can really be heard while listening calm music in low level... I know that most of customers have this issue so please try to fix it... If you fix it I rate the product as perfect!!!  Thank you),0
This is my third Bose sound system I have purchased,0
Saw this on sale for $19.95 in a daily deals email. Big sound bass. Weak on highs. Effortless connection. For $19.95 including shipping a steal.,0
I enjoy great bass and this 10-inch sub delivers.  Wish it had a EQ but the preset settings work well enough.,0
I wanted a pair of earphones that wouldn't fall out when I was jogging - these were perfect. I love the colours,0
I bought refurb direct from JBL for a great price. They work well enough and easy to pair. They are a bit awkward in appearance and it took a few times to find the right combination of ear cushions. They sound very good but bass response is not very good. They are fairly comfortable.,0
I bought this for my wife as a Christmas present.  We were able to pair it via Bluetooth to her iPhone.  We played songs from Pandora and YouTube for our kids and everyone loved the sound.,0
Bought the XSTREAM 2 months ago and absolutely love them,0
You know what you know I heard the bose wave many moons ago I was stationed in florida then California let me just say to all non believers about bose systems its music to your ears revile is at 0400 thanks bose cpo1 navy,0
I bought the Jbl charge several years ago but wanted a speaker for canoe trips !  Presto! - I can't wait for summer time!  This thing rocks!,0
These are by far the best headphones I have ever experienced. Unbeaten sound quality,0
I have tried many ear buds in the past five years and none compare. They are worth the price! Buy them. You will not be sorry!,0
Happy with purchase. Wish there were more (different) sounds available... like distant thunderstorm or midnight at the swamp or windchimes. Currently all sounds are very similar.,0
The charging cradle compliments the Revolve speaker. Definitely a must buy if you are worried about keeping the speaker juiced up!,0
I was a little on the fence about spending this amount of money on a radio but went ahead and purchased it... Now that I have heard this little machine I was blown away and realized that it is well worth every penny Bose has it priced at... Would recommend to anyone...,0
Great pedal for bluesy rock and melodies. Turn up the dials and unload hard rock. Great mix of tones and distortion. Very impressed.,0
This surround speaker is a Rockstar. Sounds great and fills up the rear surround perfectly. they are big but the sound makes up for it. Worth every penny!,0
i just bought bose soundtouch535 surround sound system . is it compatible with LG OLED TV ? just want know if its not then i'll return it .,0
I'be used BOSE products for a good few years now and this was the main driver to go down the BOSE route for this bluetooth speaker. The sound quality,0
Best speaker in price range,0
How people can say this system is lacking bass is beyond me. I have to have mine set bellow half way so I don't upset the neighbours (even on low volume) it's that punchy. It produces booming sound that is crystal clear,0
I use the ergosport band to run and it is amazing. It is sweat resistant,0
The Jbl speaker is fantastic. However the Jbl connect app not so hot. Would be great to connect more than two at once.,0
By reading all reviews,0
I got it $19.99 during promotion. You can't beat the price for the quality of the speaker. It is really portable. You can put in the pocket. I didn't get chance to test extensively,0
I've had the Camden Square for about a year now and I've been super happy with it. It has awesome sound quality and it looks great in my living room. And with up to 24 hr battery life,0
 There is one disappointment I have when I buy three had all the headphones are usually get and additional cable longer to work in the studio with quarter inch jack that's very disappointing these headphones sound amazing so I would love to try to use them in the studio as well.,0
Upgraded both of my Charge 3 to Connect+.  They connected seamlessly with the Boombox.  Party mode only.  Amazing outdoor sound.,0
I bought my subwoofer 10/4/14. I can't stop playing it. The bass is deep,0
My JBL Xtreme bumps great quality sound trough my 12 hour shift. I've taken it to the beach,0
I have been using my headphones for about 6 months now and think that they are amazing but I was using them with the aux cable and no sound was coming out on the left side speaker,0
You will never regret when you hear the sound that come out this unit. I am impress never heard something like this sound so alive.,0
Best value outdoor speaker for the money without exception!  I have not been able to experience the bigger Polk outdoor speakers but I dont think they could be much better than these.,0
I love these earbuds! I've had them for several years now (just had to buy a replacement set of enhancers) and they're the only pair that will stay in my ears while running. Love love love them!,0
Honestly,0
Having a 20 year old set of Infinity speakers,0
Just bought these and I love them. They are so comfortable and have great sound. A wonderful price also.,0
Great quality. Amazing product and service. My boyfriend loved it and he is picky over his speakers xD,0
Bought these as replacements months since I lost one on my headphones. They went on easy and haven't come off since. I use my headphones primarily for the gym and have had no issues with them. Great product!,0
Amazing sound- as expected. What I didn't like at first,0
I’ve had these for about a year now and I’d just say I can’t wait for the next ones because they are amassing the sound is way better than apple and beats and they have longer battery and have never broke or had a issue I could fix myself,0
I wanted better sound in my family room with my new 65 inch TV and my Bose Soundbar 300  and Subwoofer.  I am completely satisfied and the sound even come a little close to my Lifestyles system in my basement theater.  Buy these 2 speakers and live happily ever after.,0
to connect two speakers connect normally via bluetooth to both once connected hold both speakers bluetooth button for 10seconds or click twice on both speakers quickly its one of them but mine connect.! love jbl!!,0
Just upgraded my Subaru speakers. Nice,0
Great sound quality. Lightweight and very comfortable. However,0
You need to both hear & see to believe what this tiny wonder is capable of producing. I bought it based on reading reviews and was convinced about my decision to purchase. Turned out to be better than expected. Just go for it!,0
Had one of these in the back of my explorer for about 3 years. Better than the old JL's I had in there. And I'm sure not many better subs out there. Thoroughly satisfied. I got mine with Polk's custom sealed enclosure from Circuit City. Nice deal.,0
I bought each of my kids one for the shower! I was tired of them hauling around their speakers with cords. This is convenient,0
I Bought Bose Soundlink Speaker 5 Weeks ago.I was so Amazed about the Sounds.Took me 9 Months to save money to buy it.Unfortunately it was Stolen in my appartment 3 Weeks ago.Unless a Miracle Happen I will buy another one in April next Year!,0
"This is the best set of 6.5"" components that I have ever heard. I have these running on a Polk 500.4 amp. This setup is truely amazing.",0
I BOUGHT ONE FOR MY DAUGHTER FOR XMAS. SHE LOVES IT. I HAVE BEEN BORROWING IT FROM HER. SO I HAD TO GET ONE FOR MYSELF. I HAVE BEEN A FAN OF JBL SINCE THE '70s. EXCELLENT SOUND,0
i have this in S10 truck and it packs a punch,0
I have been wanting to try a bose home theater system for a very long time now,0
By far the best headphones I have ever owned.  They are made of good quality material. Great sound with amazing noise cancelling,0
I got this as an unexpected birthday gift. It has a surprisingly good sound (for volume and richness) for such a small package. Battery life is also quite good. Looking forward to bringing it on my holidays.,0
these speakers are great picked up the pair for 50 dollars each at futureshop on clearence sound is wicked,0
This sub is ok. I have it running off a Alpine mrp-m450 mono block amp.. it's supposed to take 400 rms.. but it doesn't like to.. when im bumpin good it starts to fry. so i turn it down and let it cool off. other than that it is loud ass hell in my 91 DA hatch.,0
I'm an old school rock and roll guy. In my day you had to spend $600 plus to get this sound. Everything from the Beatles to the Foo Fighters rocks on this little speaker. Amazing!,0
Bought these to test,0
Good sound and the noise cancelling feature is very effective. My only complaint is that there is some sound leakage so people can hear the tinny sound of music being played - have to turn the volume down in order not to offend.,0
The QC25 are a great product. The sound is so clear and crisp while still significantly reducing sound on the plane. The price is a bit higher than I would have liked to pay but I enjoy listening to them very much.,0
The Polk LSi Series are the best speakers that I have found for anywhere near the price.  I powered mine with a Parasound Halo A52 and the results are amazing.,0
I have the headphones for a couple of weeks now and I'm quite pleased with the design and sound,0
No longer are we wearing out the TV's remote. No longer do we struggle to hear the actors mutterings. From the minute we switched the Solo on our viewing experience has changed. TV's remote is now only used for turning it off or on. Brilliant.,0
I love the bass sound that Bose speakers have. The bass is great and amazing. It makes my soundbar amazing. I will be buying more Bose products in the near future. Amazing!,0
This device is excellent! I bought it because I don't have a lot of space and the sound is amazing,0
Great product for the price,0
Bought this today and am enjoying the sound quality. Bass,0
Unbelieveable!!! the best 12er ive ever had and ive been through a lot cus i like 'em loud!!! have a (meaning solo) 12 DVC in a ported box in the back of my prelude w a 1200 mono running half power to it and it dropped my rear-view the first day! Big power for small space and even smaller price!!,0
I liked mine so well,0
These are excellent speakers.  Sturdiness and stabilty are of the highest standard.  Excellent build and power.  The rear mounted amp along with the sub explodes with boom,0
Having mine charge 3 for about half a year,0
Received this as a birthday gift - not only do the slightly reduce noise cancellation (loud coffee shop,0
UlTimate punch n vibrent bass neva before heared evn the box of woofer is much better not makn body vibretion superb sound n great satisfaction ..-cool product i have swift car and happy wth this encloser,0
Wonderful.  Thats about it.  I rated this set a 5 star simply because they sound great.  I have an a/d/s 35wX4 running these and I wouldnt recommend anything else.  Best car audio component set Ive had and even heard.,0
These speakers are great!  I liked them so much- I bought another set. They look nice too......I used these in my car for awhile- (used a dc converter to plug them in and then plugged in my mp3 player--my stereo had died)  and they cranked out pretty good.,0
Setting the tuner up was a snap,0
I bought this a couple of days ago and I am loving it. The noise cancellation is as always amazing and the design really takes a 5 stars rating. So comfortable even after using them for a couple hours.,0
Ive had everything from infinity to bose..this polk psww125 is without a doubt the best sub for the money it gets u sick lows that are clean..and i mostly listen to rap and it can handle most songs.,0
The earphone has the most comfortable earbuds. Quality is great and the mic is very good and helpful. You should absolutely buy these earphones,0
Bought this for my wife for Christmas and she loves it. Great sound for a little speaker. Definitely recommend for small room or on your personal.,0
This is a wonderful system for the money. It is small and compact in size,0
I debated for two months between a well known brand and these. I wanted something small,0
I received a pair of the new QC 35 wireless headphones to test and review and they are amazing! I own the QC25's and i was absolutely blown away by this new series! Great job Bose@,0
Sound quality is amazing. no cords and they fit in your ear perfect. They are truly worth getting . SoundSport Free wireless headphones receives a 5 star rating . Don't just take my word for it buy and see for yourself .,0
Bought 4 for my friends for Christmas and they lv it. U can't go wrong with the deep bass this little clip can produce. OMG its rocks. I have a flip and that thing last for 8hrs and u can be 50 feet away and still plays without breaking up .,0
"These are some of the best sounding speakers for the price. I'm actually pretty impressed with the amount of bass they produce using just 6 1/2"" woofers. They have a very crisp clear sound across the entire sound spectrum.",0
i just bought these for $80 and they are worth every penny,0
Hi,0
Love the size,0
Got these for Christmas and just love them. I am really a light sleeper and these block out all the noises that keep me awake or wake me up once I am asleep. Now I can’t imagine not using them at night,0
i bought these for my daughter for christmas. she loved the color! the sound is awesome and they are very comfortable. good purchase,0
Great product,0
Got these because I only buy Bose products for the unbeatable sound quality but being skeptical as they NEVER stay in my ears but these are fantastic and the sound quality is typical Bose. Amazing ear buds.  Well worth it. No cords no hassle just awesome.,0
Absolutely love my Bose System. Watching films and listening to music has enhanced my viewing and listening pleasure. Cinema experience in my own living room. The bass is superb. Well done Bose.,0
Everything about this little speaker is huge! From the battery life to the explosive volume.  Even the Bluetooth connectability was far superior to my old JBL speaker. If you need a durable speaker to bring around hiking with you for a 14 hour day. Say no more,0
Very durable,0
This is a wonderful radio. Good sound,0
I have a soundbar and bose soundsports,0
I am always happy with my jbl products although there was a hiccup with shipping this time but overall still a great purchase,0
I am really happy with this product. You really do get a lot for the price. The only problem I have with this product is that you can´t move that much,0
We have a Yamaha RX-V373 5.1 surround sound system and just replaced the NS-SW40 subwoofer with a PSW10. I should have bought a PSW10 long ago because it transformed our sound system. I highly recommend buying the PSW10.,0
Exceptional precision. OK,0
I bought these about a month ago. My hearing is declining as I age. I'm on the road a lot,0
It is exactly what I expected.One thing I need to fine out is if the System III can be connected to Wireless Bose Speakers that I can sit on the patio,0
Just hooked up two speakers one at each end of the room and they sound great.  You could use one they sound so good.   I am terrible with computers stuff but was able to use the app pretty good.  Hooking up the first speaker was easy,0
Love these headphones as they fit well,0
I've always been a brand loyal person,0
after purchasing these for my laptop they are that good I use them as my main hifi speakers the mid range and depth from these is truly amazing the rich sound cleverly balanced bass there all you need well done bose,0
bought alongside smartphone,0
Awesome speakers,0
I bought this clip speaker along others.  The quality of this item is great,0
"Can't wait for the ""noise cancelling"" version.........otherwise",0
Grabbed these to have a slightly better pair of in-ears when practicing. I play bass and cello,0
I bought these a while ago since my old ones lost their cushion. I wear these to sleep and after two years of sleeping on them they understandably lost their cushion.,0
I have been a Bose L1 user since the day they came out.  Loved what they do.  This S1 hits the mark on sound quality and versatility.  Bluetooth and its flexible positioning are hits.  Missing are 48v phantom power and a DI out.  If I keep this,0
The in ear pieces could be a little smaller for my ears and a little more comfortable but all in all they're a great buy.,0
For the money and the size they are hard to beat.  I upgraded the center channel and used the one that came in the set to change my system to a 6.1...works great!,0
Love this small but perfectly formed piece of kit. Summer evenings listening to music in the garden have been so enhanced by the quality if the sound. Thank you.,0
I got these for christmas and use them fairly often. They stay in my ears really well and cancel out a lot of noise as well! My step dad has a pair too that he wears to bed and sleeps with them on really good.,0
I bought it one week ago from Conrad in Germany and till now I'm very satisfied with its performance. Great,0
They're really crisp sounding. They'll take loud volume without breaking up. The base response isn't that great but is what you'd expect for more expensive ear buds. They don't fall out of your ears and I really like being able to change tracks on the Iphone. I highly recommend them.,0
I bought three for three young adults. They love this gift. The sou d is amazing! They are using g it all the time.,0
I was at first impressed but recently they seem to have developed a fault. When the background noise is loud the earphone goes into enormous distorted overload. This results in me dragging the buds from my ears as the noise is so loud.. Any suggestions ?,0
I am not one to write lots of reviews,0
I have these under the rear seat in my pontoon boat. they have neen installed for years and hey work and sound great. This is a damp area to have speakers.,0
I bought this two weeks ago and can say Bose as done it again with an excellent piece of kit would recommend the solo 15.The remote control is excellent aswell as it controls my sky,0
Love my Bluetooth earbuds,0
I got this sub for $450CDN funds,0
I Play Open Tunings Only & It's Quite Tricky At 1st To Dial In Some Good Metal BUT ,0
Switched out my good old E90s for these and couldn't be happier. They fit like a glove in my 9 channel home theater. Outstanding sound and great price!,0
First day I had my soundsport earbuds and the clip is gone. Go to purchase New ones and they don't even sell yellow. What's up with this from a top notch company. Need some help please.,0
The sound of the JBL tune 500BT is very nice. The only point is that it is very tight at your head. When I have the JBL tune 500BT on my head,0
"Was on vacation with a cheap little store-brand speaker and thought: ""It's about time  to upgrade."" The JBL Charge 3 was highly rated",0
I brought this one after my jbl other version broke. This has a great knock. I don’t leave home without it.,0
Were ordered as Christmas presents. They arrived in time and the girls like them except they get a bit sweaty when worn to work out.,0
Have been replacing older mics with this one and the results are superior. The low cut off filter does get rid of some room rumble,0
My only complaint is they dont like the cold weather. I walk to work daily and if its -5c or colder these will turn themselves off around 20 minutes in.,0
Excellent headphones! The quiet underdog in the Bose stable! Not much press info or tech reviews on these but please do not let this put you off,0
Wow ,0
Got for Christmas 2014. Great quality ,0
I've had these for about 2 months and they're are still as powerful as when I first tried them on. JBL definitely holds up to its reputation.,0
The easiest by any means for the sound that’s not expected . Love this system,0
A friend of mine has owned a pulse for awhile and I loved his. I bought one about a month ago and love it! Great sound quality and gets really loud. Also,0
i had a local shop install this in my 1996 Tahoe and it sounds great . i am 100% surprised at the amount of bass this puts out for a small package,0
Only had it a week ,0
for its size,0
Bought this a few weeks ago to replace our old hifi system,0
They sound great but the fact they are just black,0
I chose the JBL Go by its convenient size and good sound.  Also the price offered in the store was the best online.,0
i put 2 of these gxr's in my 03 cavalier and peeple hear me from long distances and most of em dont believe that i got them for only 100. They hit harder and are just as clear as my 2 audiobahn 15's.  polk really knows how 2 price and make speakers thanks polk.,0
Had Bose forever superb product easy to set up bought one in November 17 full price got second one today with discount could not resist The sound and ease of operating second to none customer service just like the product,0
I bought the Boost tv about a month ago. The tv has amazing features and is the best televison I own! Excellent quality!,0
I’m from Brazil and so sad I cannot buy more of those. Best earphones ever. Super practic,0
These head phones are great. The sound is amazing. When i put them onn for the first time,0
I've had these speakers just over a week. Replaced a pair of R50's which I thought were outstanding.  These are awesome,0
I was determined to buy a headset from Beats but after several reviews of Apple Store employees,0
The SB100 adds great sound to your TV. You can hear lower and fuller sounds that you did not hear with the TV alone.,0
It is very secure even when you are on the go,0
This little speaker gets me to sleep at night! My daughter and I fight over it. Looks like Christmas is coming. It Valium in a box,0
I absolutely love these speakers. Very clear and accurate,0
I have a an Onkyo TX SR605 receiver (7.1,0
I truly love my Bose product. I received my SoundLink for Christmas and have not stopped using it yet. I take my Bose literally everywhere I go. I have even gone as far as purchasing one to raffle off so we can help raise money towards our booster club.,0
i thought my QC 15's were awesome,0
Bought for my son who is Autistic & he loves them!  They fit over his whole ear & have great sound.  He is a bit rough with them (this is our 2 pair of these) and the first lasted the longest out of many Bluetooth headphones (Bose,0
good sound quality and robust design,0
Bought 3 pair for Christmas and my kids and husband love them.  They are good quality. And they  look sleek and expensive.,0
I got this on Black Friday for $120. Well worth it. Could use a little brighter treble but the light show makes up for it.,0
I have flown with the Bose X for many years in all types of aircraft and the only one that it did perk in was a SNJ. I have now stepped to the A20 after many years of wanting to. The Bluetooth makes it a throw down hand.,0
I've had this speaker for years and it rocks. It's water resistant so I take it outdoors and it's quite loud. 10/10 would buy again.,0
I fly multiple aircraft,0
I just received mine yesterday,0
Its perfect! In terms of base quality its 100% one thing i dont like is the hook located at top of the device hahaha,0
I bought these about 3 months ago and I am absolutely pleased! My father made a device like this years ago to help him sleep during the day. Although primitive (made just a hissing noise) compared to these buds,0
"I bought these comparing them to my Yamaha bookshelves- boy was i in for a treat. Very good sound and great for music. Matched this with a pair of the Polk 10"" Tsi subs and I am very pleased.",0
Sound is awesome but iPhone does not fit lightning connection dock until cover is removed creating an inconvenience.,0
"They say ""Room filling sound"" but it literally is ROOM FILLING SOUND! Just a kick butt speaker all around. Love it!",0
I brought this for myself for Christmas after my boss and co-worker had one. I absolutely love everything about this JBL Flip 3 such as portability,0
I  had a yamaha center ,0
Haven't had a whole lot of chances to use this yet,0
This is the first time I have tried Polk for a system,0
I work for a local retailer of home audio products a nwe recently got the rti 6 bookshelfs in ...an i must say im so very impressed all the little imperfections of the previous series speakers where defintly fixed in this series...,0
Amazing sound,0
I am surprised at the bad reviews. I have had no problems and it sounds  amazing . I have the Bass 700 and the rear speakers. Bose store personnel are always helpful,0
+detailed and clear sound-->excellent +high volumes without screams and cracks +very good price/performance  -headband is creaking a little,0
Bought for my flight last month. Cancels out so much background noise. Excellent it's like your in your own world.,0
This thing has a huge battery. Something like 7000mah. The speaker has great bass and low end as well as mid range. It could use a little more in the high end,0
This speaker is great,0
Very nice sound for the size and price. Some midrange presence and a bit short on the highs and of course the bass given the size,0
It´s impressive to see the new design for these in-ear headphones ant the same as with the sound. Thanks Bose!!,0
It is almost a year that I have using these headphone on and off and no problem what so ever,0
Using it for more than a month now,0
I bought this on December 26/2018 and Two days after I bought a second one.... Awesome Sound and Much Better when you pair both of them...!,0
Just received this yesterday. Easy setup. Cables provided completely compatible with SINY 7 channel receiver.,0
It took me all of 5 minutes to connect my Samsung and sky box to remote and the sound is simply the best,0
I love these do far,0
Purchased two of these for family members.  They sound great.  They charge quickly and are extremely easy to set up.,0
This speaker I have in my bedroom and fills the room ( 20x18' ) with high quality sound'. Works very well with my other Bose equipment to give great sound through the house. The app works well with the speaker.,0
These headphones have the excellent sound quality I have become used to from BOSE products. They stay in the ears through rigorous exercise like tennis and running. I wouldn't trade them for any other. Keep making great products BOSE.,0
I'm using this amp driven by a JBL MS-8. The amp is a good step up from your typical 20W/channel systems. Very noticeable gain difference in that it plays loud and clean w/little distortion. Using 2 of 4 channels bridged for a passive sub and that works well too. Recommended.,0
I bought this about 3 months ago and I love it. Its not big on base but it has a smooth and balanced sound. Blue tooth is excellent and the center speakers sound good without the sub unit.,0
It is really very nice,0
I recently purchased these speakers brand new for $38.00 each on clearance and I am very pleased with the sound of these speakers I also listen to the R15s and I wonder why they were made,0
Purchased this speaker for my desk in work.  I can listen to my own music & pandora from my phone.  Has great sound and easy to use.  I've received many compliments on the sound from this little speaker.,0
I had the older generation of wave for about 5 years now,0
"Bought it few weeks ago and I didn't pay to much and got the best sound I could possibly get for this price. ""In my opinion""",0
Bought this for my sons 20th birthday and he hasn't stopped using it since we gave it to him.  He was keen to have a Bluetooth waterproof speaker that wouldnt easily damage and thus speaker fits the requirement perfectly.,0
These by far are,0
This product very good few weeks before i buy its  very good product and i am very happy ato use this.i like all jbl product,0
Great sound and I mean great !!! Battery life is amazing,0
This is a nice speaker. It was worth the sale price. The regular price is to high. If it were not for the sale,0
Compared against similar Bose and Harman Kardons...no competition.  This set had the most crisp highs and punchy lows of the group.  The recommended setup works really well.  A buddy just spent much more for a set of Boston Acoustics and frankly,0
I bought this product  a few weeks ago and it has never let me down. Battery life is great for a person like me who is always on the move as well as the comfort which is excellent for it being in ear headphones,0
I bought this 3 month ago and it has greatest quality.And silver one is better than black one.If you buy this headphone,0
I just received my headphones today and am greatly pleased with the NC improvement compared to the QC15. I've owned the QC 15 for years and was getting really tired of the cable catching on everything. The only thing I'm disappointed with is the QC 35 cord doesn't have a mic for phone calls.,0
Love them. Been using them in bed for birth meditation. Not having cords is convenient.  I'm Excited to use them for my water birth!!! Then I'll be using them eventually on runs and workouts!,0
I have this amp for 2 weeks and I like how much power this sub can handle. I am pushing 2 s3-1224 with it and it does amazing job. This thing doesnt even heat up. Its class d amp so it draws very little power. I wish it comes with the bass control knob. But I am planning to buy the controller.,0
The led doesnt sync with android( im not sure about all,0
Fantastic sound gave my cds a new lease of life got this for xmas and it dosn,0
man these are the speakers i have been looking for quite some time now,0
I'm consistently amazed at the fit of these earbuds. So soft you'll forget there on. Love the reinforced cable too,0
I have tried a lot of sound-bars out there from brands like Sonos,0
I just purchased my headphones last week and I'm glad it's been the best investment on headphones I made in awhile,0
These speakers really rock w/ My Eclipse Stereo and I bought the db651's in the front to match. The bass is amazing and I'm not running an amb yet. Worth the money by far. The Clarity is amazing.,0
I originally had the HP speakers,0
Great reception,0
I brought these speakers the other day and i am really happy with these but i have a question. is there a way to link these with other Bose speakers or not.,0
This was a great buy! After trying similar sized wireless bluetooth speaker from other brands,0
Bought the Flip 4. Not bad for sound quality and size. But wa made when the battery died after using for only 5 hours. The box said it could run for 12 hours.,0
Like other reviews I'm disappointed about the durability of ear phone pads. Expensive headphones deserve a better quality material. Comfort is great,0
It has great battery and lasts me pretty long which is good however the annoying thing is,0
Guys what’s with the huge box that is not needed...waste people ffs I get you try to make the unintelligent think there getting value for money but come on think of the environmental impact those boxes have... make it smaller and lower your costs seriously. Great product but the box fm.,0
These Speakers blew me away,0
I have had this for 3 years and have dropeed it tons and used it tons. Its quality has never faltered and the design is fiiit.,0
I ordered these and got them 3 days later and the shipping was free! These enhancers are the only earbuds that fit comfortably without pain.,0
I paid 50.. but is amazin small and big sound ... i got many smller bluetooth speakers,0
This Bose product has lived up to ever expectation I had and more. It is a must have for any home or music enthusiast.,0
Fantastic range at all volumes.  Loud as you could possibly require.  If you can find these anywhere,0
I Love them so far. I thought they didn't fit properly around my ears but It was user error (I'll admit it). I also like that nobody else has them in my gym. Always love the sound quality from the subs in the trunk to the headphones on my dome.,0
I bought 4 of these in College because I wanted better sound than the loud people across the street. 15 years later no problems,0
I bought this for my husband. He has the Quiet Comfort 15. The wireless Quiet Comfort 35 II is just what he needed. The sound quality is amazing while blocking out distracting background noise of a household. Glad I made this purchase. He uses it with his ipad downloads,0
The JBL Trip is the one speaker that small but it has a good quality ,0
Fits snug! I've had it for 2 months and take it everywhere. Everyone that sees it loves it,0
I recently purchased the Polk rtiA9 speakers and I love these floor standing speakers. Simply Amazing!!!,0
Damn good speakers.  Heard things I never knew existed in my DVD movies before.  Coupled with a CS1 center,0
Just received my new SoundSport Free headphones in today's mail.  They're SUPERB!  Sound,0

"Enjoying my Sound Touch 30 and wondering if I can add a second one for a ""stereo sound"" in my studio.",0
I'll never use my tv for sound again.  The Solo 15 brings big,0
Just turn it on and press Bluetooth. You get blown away like to were a much larger speaker. Well worth the money!,0
This system really enhanced the sound quality of my Sony tv. I WATCHED TWO MOVIES last night ,0
The speaker has good performance and battery life. The only issue I have is the base is designed poorly,0
Just loved them. Seriously the battery lasts the whole six hours,0
This is a great add for anyone who is tired of bla bla bla yada yada yada radio. It gives you choice. I never turn on my regular am/fm anymore. It was great to integrate this unit with my whole house entertainment center.,0
I had it for one day bought from Best Buy next day speaker did't turn the power on. Great sound quality.,0
Bought these while traveling for work,0
I just installed a pair of these in my 2003 Bayliner. The sound is awesome and the clarity is top notch. It's so nice to be able to have quality sound on the water and not worry about a little spray destroying your tunes.,0
Confortable,0
I have enjoyed my new Bose headphones! I use them running and they sound great with no problems. I never thought I would use the mobile microphone part,0
Absolutely love it,0
Fantastic I use this every day and it makes every movie I watch sound like I'm in a professional cinema while in the comfort of my own home,0
I bought this about 3 weeks ago.  I'm very happy with sound,0
I bought these as replacements when I lost one. These are exactly the same as the ones that come with the headphones. Excellent Trade and Fast shipping!,0
I absolutely love using this for parties and even just hanging by the pool! Perfect sound and works great with the music I stream from my phone! Love it,0
so glad I got this....The only issue I had was I had to wait to wait a month to get it...Well worth the wait !!,0
I've been using mine for a little over a year. The sound is fantastic and the battery life is better than expected. It's a great deal for the money.,0
I live in the country where my nearest neighbor is over 1/4 mile away.  These speakers crank out the music.  I loved the first one so much that I bought a second one...  I made the mistake of allowing my daughter to take it to college...  I highly recommend this system.,0
Great headphones with easy bluetooth setup.  I though about getting the noise canceling ones,0
Just received my cinemate 15 system ....All I can say is WOW. .So much power in this small system....5 stars ..period..,0
They seem to be more comfortable than the originals...let's see how long they stay in place and not start coming off all the time...,0
I LOVE this it sounds great best sound EVER!!! I didn't expect the quality of this product would be so great!,0
Excellent sound quality,0
Bought mine from currys pc world I wanted to be genuine don't know what you get from online shop's. This device is amazing I can't believe what sound come out from it. The bass is like you have big speakers and clarity is brilliant to. You need to go in the store and try it I have no words....,0
Very happy with the item so far. Use it for my PS4 to have sounds when the controller. Outstanding and JBL hit this one out of the park.,0
I have had these speakers for 12 years and they've never failed me. I will never buy any other brand of speaker for my home,0
The Bose sound sport are light weight comfortable to where the clip on the wire will be your best friend,0
Bought QC35 recently and omg they are just something else... sound is amazing,0
I've been waiting for the around the ear,0
Closed back phones. Great for keeping out noise on the bus and they sound great too. I listen to hard rock and lots of podcasts and love being able to hear the vocals on both without having to put the volume on max while on the bus.,0
Works seamlessly with our Google Chromecast! Relatively lightweight for a product that can do so much! The only thing the Google assistant doesn't seem to get right is the alarms and timers. They are always off by a couple of minutes.,0
Wow,0
I bought this speaker a month ago and have been fairly impressed with it. The speaker has impressive sound quality and volume for its size. The only thing that could better would be battery life. The speaker battery only lasts about 4 hours,0
The clarity of my music through these headphones is wonderful. The noise cancelling adds to the listening experience and the Bluetooth gives you the freedom - brilliant.,0
absolutely satisfied... sure JBL quality... I am clipping on my bicycle...!!!!   How can take my tunes with you when I go riding... cool stuff...,0
The Charge 3 really over delivers.  Clear at all volumes,0
Music has never sounded any better! It still amazes me how a speaker this small produces such an amazing sound that fills my room always. The bass blows my mind.,0
Love this system,0
Best wireless headset I have owned. Better than some $200 dollar ear buds that I had. The only gripe I have has to do with the buttons. It is hard for me to feel the difference between the buttons when not looking at the controls.,0
I bought this a month ago to play in the bathroom . It sounds amazing ,0
I bought this about 8 years ago. still going strong ! I just ordered a new remote for it but speaker still works great.When I buy  a new vehicle,0

Very happy with the item! The bass is exceptional. The technology (bluetooth) makes the connectivity effortless.,0
If you’re a fan of the Boombox,0
After market cable lacked the hi/lo switch on the so to get oem quality I came to bose to get the original so glad I did,0
I bought this  headphone one month for my son,0
I bought my SDA SRS 2.3's in 1990. I have never heard a speaker I like better. I have also been offered more than I payed for them. Of course,0
I’m at a hotel and they have this as the alarm clock and I figured out all the controls easily. The alarm wakes me up even though im a very heavy sleeper.,0
Amazing!!!! I love this,0
We bought this speaker months ago and still love it. We use it on our patio when relaxing outside. The sound is amazing!! The battery seems like it lasts forever too!! My Mac battery needs charging more frequently than this speaker!!,0
Used daily. No actual failure until 3 years old. Now one ear only. There’s worked hard. However,0
I was in the Bose store picking up other items when I noticed the sound quality of the Solo15. I bought it immediately. Setup is easy,0
I love this headphones,0
really great distortion pedal. the EQ sweeps allow you to dial it up really cool. from metal to all out fuzz,0
I bought four of these for Christmas gifts. Then I tested one. Next thing I know,0
Wow! I have had my eye on this speaker for a while and finally decided to buy one. I'm so happy I did. This thing is loud! It's exactly what I was looking for. The sound is great.. plus the bass is where it's at! Thank you for making such a great product.,0
It sounds great,0
The sound quality is great! Much better than other brands. I can set my phone down and still hear my music while I walk across the gym. The battery seems to last forever. They are comfortable and don't slip out of my ears when I run or lift weights. I would definitely by these again.,0
I got this delivered today from Amazon India and I am absolutely satisfied with the service of Amazon and Bose. The sound is amazing and true value for money.,0
As my predecessor already said,0
service was great,0
I am very pleased with this system.  A few months prior to this purchase,0

One of my friends recommended this speaker because it has an amazing sound quality,0
I have had my Polk 4000 Sound Bar for over a year now and it has worked great. I use it with my bedroom tv and it gives an extraordinary sound without all the messy wires. I would how ever recommend to upgrade to the 6000 model if you are useing it in a larger room.,0
I'm happy with my 580s. But the customer service representative promised me 10 discount  when I reorder because of incomplete address. Broken promise sad to say.,0
Best speaker around. Quality sound,0
bought this last week when i fire it up i am really amazed on the sound and bass is powerful mid and highs is balanced very wide sound stage 301 is worth for the bucks,0
If you are looking for around-ear headphones that provide great sound quality and depth,0
My right plug just died - don't fancy shelling out another £80 for another pair.  You should do a replace or repair service - loved these phones.,0
not my first set if these - - I love the tiny model that you can wear comfortably inside a ski helmet,0
I must tell you that the new FXi5s not only rocks the house you can hear things in movies and in music you never knew where their.These speakers have such a rich full sound to them you can place them anywhere .Well worth the price get them you wont be sorry.,0
thes subs ROCK!. i have mine ina 72 plymouth duster. when circut city hooked them up. to my 1,0
Bough these headphones for going out of the house and around town and love the sound quality and comfort of them... Doesn't get very loud though and wish it had more volume but my best headphones so far!,0
Great sounding stayed in my ear never fell out phone mic worked perfectly 5 stars for sure. I accidentally closed them in my car door so I need to get a replacement pair but for the 5 months I used them business,0
Bought these as part of my ongoing search to find a comfortable pair of headphones to wear at the gym. My search is over. These puppies are comfortable and do not require the constant re-adjustment that my previous pair of headphones required.,0
Tried these out and instantly loved them! It completely blocks out any noise. Other noise cancelling headphones don't even come close to this amazing product!,0
Great all around for a fair price.Doesnt kill your wallet and has some of the best audio I've had out of any earbuds,0
I love it,0
I bought this unit to use in my basement studio but when I saw the good looks I opted to use it for my home theatre. WOW!!!!,0

As soon as I opened the box I knew it was going to be excellent. When I turned it on it had 50% battery so I could use it straight away and had my phone connected within seconds. The sound is is crisp and clear its amazing how Bose dose it. Very very happy with it.,0
I was originally thinking about buying a beats pill or a JBL flip,0

I bought my pair of Synchros S700's October 2013,0
Great speaker! Clear crisp audio when paired via bluetooth. My only disappointment with it is the volume when connected via the aux. jack is substantially less than when using bluetooth. If Bose could fix that it would rate a 5+,0
Originally purchased for holidays,0
The QC 35 acts like magic. Once you put it on your ear,0
I'd give the headphones 5 stars if the cord were more robust. It appears that,0
I have two speaker they sound nice love them. The only thing I don't like is that you can't pair them together! In order for me to play them at the same time,0
I heard this in a store and loved it immediately! The bass is good,0
I passed my old headphones to the charity shop,0
Great set of speakers. Just up grade my home thearter system. I have a very large open room  They fill the room with wall shaking bass and sound.,0

Its simply amazing!!!...a battery option would have been beneficial though. amazing sound clarity..and worth the money...it's after all BOSE!...Salute your work!!,0

I have this sub running off of a JBL GTO 1201.1 and this thing sounds awesome. It's really clean and pretty hard.,0
We bought one of these a year ago and loved it so much that we bought another one for the spare room.  The USB charger is useful and we particularly like the ambient lighted display.,0
I bought this last week and I am very impressed with the sound and bass produced from this little speaker.,0

The Bose Wave system III is great could not believe how good the sound it producers,0
The Sound is amazing,0

I wanted something that I could strap to the handlebar of my bike when I am out riding. This little thing sounds better than it has any right to sound. BUY IT if you have the right application. It's my 3rd Bose product and I pleased with all three of them.,0
I own the waterproof Charge 3 and it's awesome. Easy to pair and use and you never have to worry about where you take or use it since it waterproof.,0
I bought the sound bar 500 including sub and surround sound speakers with stands and have it hooked up to a 60 inch Sony tv and it’s amazing with sound for both movies and music.,0
Bought these as a gift for my 12yr old. I read previous reviews and people loved them but I was still skeptical.  Once received I was happy. The white is very cute and sound is good. Love how the ears fold in. Price is awesome. Now my mom now wants a pair but the white is sold out. :(,0
Works & sounds very good,0
I bought this 2 weeks back and it is really very nice. I strongly recommend this....worth for ur money,0
I replaced these with some bs speakers i got from ebay. The speakers were supposed to handle 700 watts. Thats right 700 WATTS. These speakers kicked its ass the second they were in my car. All I can say is WOW!!!!! Great Great speakers for the price and for quality. GO POLK,0
I buy this to replace my OE Bluetooth Bose,0
The freestyle earbuds are the best earbuds I have ever had! They fit great in the hear,0
I love the sound quality and the case,0
These SoundSport headphones are excellent! They're very,0
Bought it for a present for my son because he's in the army and it small and portable but WAS VERY DISSAPOINTED THAT IT DID NOT Come WITH A CASE TO PROTECT IT or A MAINS ADAPTOR ...??????? How do I get these items,0
I have had my JBL flip for a few years and I love it. I have never had any issues with connectivity. It has been dropped,0
I have had this sub since they came out and I have a 19'x23' room and the sub still sounds great hooked up to a Onkyo receiver and rti70 front speakers and fxi30 for surround,0
This SoundTouch 20 speaker is brilliant. Easy to set up,0
I bought these headphones a couple of months ago and they are the best that i have had. Cannot hear anything that other members of the family are saying to me [annoying them intently].Sound quality is superb like being at a concert you can hear every instrument individually great buy,0
I bought a pair of JBL Studio 290 floor standing speaker and a JBL Arena Sub 100P and my Acom audio system  now sounds great!!!,0
I've wanted a quality BT speaker for the longest time,0
I have a 2009 Scion tC and it took us a good 2 hours just to get the first one in and figure out what we we’re doing. Besides the dreadful installation,0
I have had issued with apple headphones staying in my ear when I was just sitting down let alone working out! These headphones are a lifesaver and I work out in them with ease. I have 3 pairs!,0
I did get the Bose headset for my cell buy accident,0
i bought this a week ago and they are really comfortable and sound great,0
Sound quality is astonishing. Great base and smooth sounds. It's not perfect but can still improve. Audio has been delayed to bouncing a few times while on bike. (It's not meant for resting or sleeping).,0
The sound is great,0
Very pleased with this product,0
Does what it needs to do well and looks good. Good sound a bit locking in the midrange but it's a portable waterproof speaker. Love it,0
I found this JBL flip in the ditch of a dirt road on my morning run. It had been raining,0
Bought this after xtreme 2 came out because the price dropped,0
These things are on point like a number 2 pencil!!! They can get extremely loud without distortion and can really boom the bass too. I two mm691 in the front and two mm651 in the back with a rockford fosgate punch amp and they are amazing!!!!,0
Bought this as a Christmas gift and was told it was an awesome speaker,0
The sound quality on this system is just flawless. I already have a SoundTouch™ 20 Series I and this new device compliments my existing one to give a true multi-room,0
I was replacing my old headphones and these are definitely a step up.  Great sound and value.  Ordering was easy and they arrived quickly.,0
I just got this today and I love this. Its so loud the base is great and I am glad I purchased this speaker. You have to get it. The light show is amazing. Can't wait to show it off at work. I was going to get a Bose but got this instead so glad I did.,0
I’ve been very happy with the buds. Accidentally left one in a cab last night and still trying to replace. Please let me know how I can order a new right ear bud. Thanks so much! CW,0
Working for me since 2016,0
I LOVE MY R50S THEY HAVE A NICE RICH,0
these are incredible speakers. i had a pair of monitor 10 polk speakers and sold them when i got these. the sound is incredible better the the monitor 10. the size is also small so they dont take up as much room. will own these forever.,0
I've tried many headphones but they've not been right and have hurt my ears but these are so comfortable it doesn't even feel like I'm wearing them. And the sound quality is out of this world. It's definitely a product I'll recommend to friends and family who love their music as much as Me.,0
This is a very satisfying radio and glad I made the purchase. The CD-MP3 player is a real plus. Larry F.,0
My friends bought wireless headphones too,0
I definitely made the best decision and picked these. The sound is incredible. No lag when watching movies. Easy to use and do not fall out. I work outside and these can handle the Florida humidity.,0
This is a life saver. I had a different product that broke immediately. This one stayed strong and is comfortable.,0
For the size and price,0
I bought these speakers at Fry's Electronic in San Jose. The price was really low for only $175.99 per speaker. I used to dream to own these speakers,0
I have only had these a week so far there great sound quality is awesome I like the appearance of them!!,0
First day of use....2 hours at the gym. You hear nothing but the music from the earbuds. Rich and deep bass. Clear mids and highs. The buds stay in your ear....and the collar around the neck seems to not be there at all....Happy with my new acquisition!,0
This system was easy to set up and it sounds incredible.  The wifi and bluetooth connectivity make it easy to listen to music,0
My friend had this speaker at her party and the quality was amazing! Will certainly be purchasing one for myself sometime soon!,0
My friend has a JBL speaker and I loved it so,0
They sound great and fit is secure  even working out  the only drawback I would say would be the location of the volume and power control its to close to the ear and a little annoying and har d to access. Thank you.,0
This sound system boxes way above its weight. When using the radio it sometimes has too much base. But all in all I love it.,0
I love these things but there is a trick to getting the best sound. You got to boost the Bass. You can do this through EQ under Music on the I Phone. But I belive after that they are some of the best earbuds I have owned.,0
This was one of the best Bose purchases I’ve ever made.  The sound,0
Bought this 4days ago and I must say it's the best wireless speaker in the market. I use my iphone,0
Impressive sound fills my room with more than enough great sound. Would like to thank the guy at Safe& Sound in Chicopee Ma,0
Best wireless speaker out there.  Fantastic sound and no issues at all.  Charges easily and charge lasts for up to 24 hours of continuous play.  Highly recommend,0
I just got my one today and I can say it makes really good sound! Its way better than my Beats Pill! I got the blue and that little thng is so well! I'm saying just buy it!,0
this sub is the shit if you want power this is it it hits so hard from my 1994 ford exploer that i can make dishes fall of the table inside and i only got 2 and a 800 watt polk audio amp and rember polk is tha shiznit so 4 all u peeps who like to rumble it dont get no more bad ass than polk,0
I bought revolve+ 1 year ago and i just love to hear any and everything on it. It has been impressing everyone.. Superb design and outstanding sound quality. Always Bose...,0
I looked around for a home subwoofer in this price range.  This one blows all the competition away.  All the others I looked at distorted when you turned up the volume,0
Delighted with our purchase we need to add a few things and we are about Tom purchase some headphones,0
Brought this couple of weeks ago. Tried all types of songs,0
Sound bar sounded tinny at first but once the drivers stretched their legs more of the mid range came forward. The bass is unparalleled to any other sound bar I have heard but if it is too overwhelming it can be turned down. I would recommend.,0
- awesome sound for the size !  It's great for small indoor occasions. I would recommend the JBL charge if you would like a speaker that would begetter fit for a party.,0
The best Bluetooth earphones. Happy to have bought these. My first bose. And being a keen music listener.... They are such a treat,0
Outstanding!  Add this to a quality receiver like a Denon 870 with automatic setup capability and you will enjoy that smug feeling of a great acquisition every time you turn on the TV!,0
I followed the instructions carefully and the setup went smoothly. The ease of use and versatility of the system are outstanding. It is early yet as I just installed and tested the unit. I hope the Bose SoundTouch proves to be strong and hardy over time.,0
Great sub for the price! Was looking for a responsive sub that retained deep bass,0
Some one complained about the price. Yes...it's excessive,0
I purchased this set in 1999 and have never looked back.  They are PERFECT in every way.  True home theatre at the perfect price.  And that great Polk Audio Customer Service.  You can't go wrong.,0
I bought these for Christmas and there perfect. I have the beats solo's and these win by far. The sound quality is UNBELIEVABLE!!!! I totally recommend!!!!!!!,0
Great audio,0
Have a nice sound for the size.  Great highs and ample mid and low range for 4X6 speakers.  I get a little distortion at high volume with 25 watts RMS,0
I just bought two of the MM104's and have the C500s model polk amp is this going to be enough power for two of these subs? will it be under powered? can you do harm to the sub if its under powered? Sorry im just learning. cant wait to try them,0
I bought these 6 months ago and use them often.  I love them for hiking and walking and connecting to my phone with Bluetooth! I'm buying more!!,0
These are amazing speakers. I upgraded from a pair of R50's. I have had these RTi8's for about 4 months now,0
I absolute love these headphones! yoi have never heard music in this way before! The quay lift is great!,0
Polk RTI-4's OWN there price range.  The RTI-4 even beats out more expensive Polks!  Until you hit the LSI-9's there isn't a better bookshelf speaker from Polk Audio.  I get to put these guys up against Totems,0
The sound quality is amazing for something this size.Would highly recommend it to any one you wiil not be disappointed.,0
i bought this above six months before.i sell my sony sub.its great..low price and more effective. very better than my old sony SAW M500 SUB.thanks polk.,0
Perfect...!! It exceeds my expectations.  I am extremely happy with my Bose SoundTouch 300 sound bar.  Was easy to install.  Sounds great at low volume ,0
Great set of headphones,0
I have two set of JBL speakers,0
this sub woofer kicks perfectly,0
The speaker is really what they claim it is. Tiny until you turn it on. More bass,0
Bought this the other day great sound quality and looks very stylish. Easy to set up and very easy to use. Definitely going to buy more!!!,0
I bought this magic a month ago and I am fully satisfied. I tried many headsets and found the best Noise cancellation and comfort in QC35. Thanks.,0
I got these on my birthday and the sound quality is so amazing !! I got the blue one...the colour is so vibrant and beautiful. I LOVE THIS....!!!!!!!,0
I bought this speeker and im really happy with it. Its play really good and lightshow gives more experience. The only thing i would love to change is that annoying and loud noise when i turn on and off my speeker,0
I bought three of these in a sealed box a while ago. they hit so hard. these are really good subs at a resonable price. I have a rock fordfosgate 1000watt amp powering the subs.,0
Perfect for in the kitchen. As a chef I enjoy having music play in the kitchen while working,0
I love these things they pound hard. My neighbors don't like me anymore but who needs them! they are very nice in my '94 taurus. i need a new amp though well worth the money. if your looking for a good system look no longer!!,0
This is a quality product,0
Great quality. Sounds nice as bluetooth headphones. Easy pairing with the device.  Citron ones look great. I've waited for month.,0
I actually owned this as my first Bluetooth speaker and I loved it! It lasted me a good while as well and was very durable considering I'm a clumsy.,0
I ordered my Charge 3 some time late Saturday night into Sunday morning and it arrived Tuesday evening! I love the presentation of the packaging so beautiful and professional. The speaker it self is amazing quality and the bass is crystal clear the best sound I've ever heard in the portable speaker.,0
I purchased a miDock Portfolio,0
so far everything is awesome,0
Jbl flip 4 is a really great speaker,0
I bought this last year n I'm so happy with price wise quality sound I love Bose becouse 3 sound system in my house plus headphone classic super duper.,0
this sub is amazing bought one from bestbuy hooked it up to my 300 watt jenson. kicks lik u wouldnt believe. i shook off my rear view mirror.,0
The headphones are comfortable and of high quality. I find that the volume received with these are not as loud as other ear buds.,0
I got this the other day and I just love it great sound and the disco lights just make it even greater,0
This little speaker has MASSIVE sound. I was blown away the first time I switched it on and started banging my hip hop. Base,0
I bought the speaker a while ago and it has some technical issues but it still sounds great. The speaker is good indoors and okay outdoors. The speaker is a little quiet for a bbq but that's what you would expect from a speaker the size of your palm.,0
I bought this product about a week ago now,0
After reading so many reviews I pulled trigger on these,0
Great sound when playing songs not heavy on the bass. The one thing it needs is a EQ,0
i just got this yesterday and i do not regret it at all. I recomend it to anyone that likes loud music,0
Awesome performance for price. Will handle big class D amps as well as low powered systems and sound bumpin good.,0
Great customer service. Good price value. Not so easy to setup but once you figure it out it’s very easy. Great technology. Love JBL,0
Overall I love this speaker minus the no aux port. Having a good bass is a must for me and the sound quality is always top notch for JBL and I think it may be better than the Flip . The only thing I did not like was that the Google assistant didn't work without the WiFi.,0
We bought this speaker when on holidays about a year and a half ago.  The sound is amazing for such a small unit.  While using it outside it vibrated off a table on our sun deck falling onto a brick patio below about 10 feet.  Other than a dent in the side it still works and sounds great!,0
"They sound good ... and I hope they will last ...ask me 5 years from now.  Would gladly have spent more for them to have been ""Made in USA""  JBL speakers like it used to be.",0
The Best in its class! Awesome sound quality,0
After 24+ years these babies are still amazing! I've had them sitting idle for a few years,0
I've bought mine creature II about 8 or 10 yrs ago and still working perfectly! I'm looking for new ones now and this is going to be my choise for sure. Highly recommended to everyone!,0
"i just bought 2 pairs or these speakers to find out that these ""6.5"" speakers dont fit my 6.5 factory places. then after 1 day of listening to them 2 of the woofers went on me. besides that though they sound excellent and would highly reccomend them",0
Switched to them after QC15,0
Love these headphones for traveling but I am so disappointed they will not connect to my laptop...that is a bit ridiculous,0
I needed a bluetooth speaker for my IPAD. I could not believe the sound,0
I've owned by QuiteControls for 2 years now,0
I sleep next to a person who snores. These have let me sleep a full night. I have not had this in years!,0
i have bought two of this headphones to my dad ,0
I love the good quality sound,0
Just hooked this up and it was very easy to do and sounds really good for such a small speaker very happy with this!,0
i bought to use it in my car to record everything so i can see how i drive. It really good value for money and it has not let me down since i had it and will say it very good value  and we work well every car.,0
I just picked up a pair of these and installed them today. When I turned them on I was amased how well they sounded,0
I love my headphones,0
very tough product. fantastic battery life. i use it almost every day. had mine for 3 years and only the ear muffs have fallen apart. I'm very rough with the product and often workout with it on. (why the muffs are started to tear). well worth the money,0
I bought this for myself for Christmas and I love it. I accidentally bought the black when I meant to order it in pink so my bad,0
Purchased two this past weekend. Set both up in no time. Sound is great and working the volume from a cell or pad makes adjusting the levels so easy. Its great to hear the quality of the music as you walk from one room to another. Considering a 3rd to make the entire house a Bose boom box.,0
Originally I was going with the Sonos,0
THE SPEAKERS ARE BEAUTIFUL TO LOOK AT & SOUND GREAT FOR THE PRICE THERE WORTH 600.00 A PAIR OR MORE .GREAT JOB POLK AUDIO THANK YOU FOR MY SIDE & REAR  SPEAKERS,0
It works great for any application! I use this amp for my polkmomo 6,0
Best choice for work! These pair of headphones are so reliable that I've been using them for more than a year and there no issue with them,0
Compact headphones for children that also has volume limiter. Cable is on a single side of the headphones to avoid getting tangled. Kids love them as are more comfortable than in ear headphones and have soft cushioned ear pads! They are brightly coloured too! Would be great for travelling!,0
From the moment i set up the system i have not been dissapointed .Sound is exceptionally high quality,0
Dollar for dollar is the absolute best system you can purchase. All my Bose loving friends are eating thier hearts out now!,0
I blew out my Cerwin-Vegas and replaced them with these.  I almost fell over when I cranked them up to Why Part II from Collective Soul.  Man I could not believe how clear they sounded.,0
I did not think that this quality of sound was possible from such a small device. Early days yet,0
I got these a month ago and was not expecting the great sound. JBL out did them selfs with these. If you like a lot of bass these aren't for you but if you want to hear the full spectrum of sound you'll be extremely pleased with these.,0
Originally ordered in March but not available for immediate delivery. I'm glad I waited and it paid off. Everything about it is outstanding. I just hope I enjoy it for many years. Should have bought two.,0
SIMPLY AMAZING! It's hard to believe that such a compact speaker like this can play music very loud in a great sound quality! The speaker makes me instantly think that Bose always puts a lot of effort into making great products that are definitely worth the money.,0
Ive had other head phones ,0
My husband bought me my sound dock for my birthday it is amazing the sound that comes out of it is clear and just fantastic can't praise it enough,0
It has an incredible sound and the button location is great! It is really comfortable and it's easy to use! Overall it the best headphone I bought if you are unsure to buy these I highly suggest you do.,0
I bought the link 10 and will likely be buying another one soon.  It bring any room I take it into to life and makes my homegroup sound amazing !,0
I purchased the Companion 50 in November 2017. Using it with my Television for Movies and Gaming(PS4). The experience is immersive surround for movies and games. A must have for budget minded and for someone with a viewing distance upto 10 feet.,0
I bought these speakers for christmas and they're the best speakers I've ever owned. They have a amazing sound quality for the price.,0
i ran into these when i was gonna buy a center channel speaker for the rti8 instead i bought the rti10 for the same price so i took the rti8 back.and couldnt be anymore happier,0
I am loving every minute of this Bose wireless speaker!! I can't believe it to so loud! My family thought I was using my big speaker I bought for my living room. The sound quality is amazing! So clear,0
I love these. I have small ears so it's hard to find just the right ear bud. They are comfortable and sound good! Sadly I dropped my pair and they were crunched by someone's car. But I love them so much I'm investing in another pair.,0
Bose has been my favorite product for a long time. At first I was not too convinced,0
Amazing product can not find fault! Was amazed at how easy it was to set up and now at a touch of a button I can listen to all my music in one place without messing around with wires highly recommended,0
excelent speakers... i had before MB QUART DSE 216. changes: the tweeters are more agressive,0
I purchased this same model and had it installed at sound wharehouse however I think the installer may have left out the high level input connectors on my amplifier how do I obtain the high-level input connector for the GT-BassPro 12,0
True sound with deep bass... very good balance with bass getting more pronounced as you up the volume.,0
I have had several sets of nose headpohones and they are my favorite by all means but I am a little disappointed with the max volume. Beats volume can turn up so loud it hurts my ears . But I wouldn’t trade these for theam as the clearing is way better in my opinion.,0
I bought these one week ago and I am verry happy about it. I placed them in my bedroom. What a sound! Great Bass... Sounds very clear and good detail. Thank You!,0
I bought this it came out for 2 months. The battery was so long,0
Really easy to use - just charge them up and then sync them with your device. Light weight and easy to transport when you’re on the go. I would definitely recommend this to anyone with kids who use tablets.,0
I have only had these for a few weeks but the sounds is good.  My only concern is the covering on the ear pads.  Seems a little lightweight and don't know how long they will last.,0
I bought this as a birthday present for a friend. She loves it. Called me using he speakerphone function today and told me how much she loves it. Sound quality was good for the call. Nailed it.,0
I bought this Subwoofer about  2 weeks and half ago.  I am extremely happy with the sound.  Also,0
Hi ...I bought my Bose a few months ago and I couldn't be happier !! The sound this system lets out is amazingly incredible !!  The Bluetooth feature is a definite must !!  Sync's easily with my Spotify.  Absolutely worth the investment ! Thanks Bose !  : ),0
I bought these the first time i saw the available date. Im a prime member on Amazon so i ordered them and have been happy with them ever since. I bought the accompanying case that has easy recharging also. Super easy to use with the app on my iPhone. Gonna be a Bose customer for life.,0
I'LL GIVE THIS PSW125 TOP NOTCH. GOT THIS ON SALE ONLY LESS $49.99 AT BEST BUY AND THAT WAS A STEAL. ALREADY UNDER-PRICED BUT WHAT A PERFORMANCE. GOT THIS A YEAR AGO AND STILL DOING WHAT ITS SUPPOSED TO DO. BOOOOOOMMMMMED AND BOOOOMMMMED......,0
A big fat yes.I own the first solo system.I give a rateing of very good. The new solo15 I rate outstanding. It has a wider sound scape and better bass,0
I tried this soundtouch 10 nice speaker but it is really need to find a powerplug not recomended to out of town... I need to use again my soundlink mini....,0
I bought these on sale about 4 years ago,0
Our son bought this for us for Christmas. We cannot believe the quality of sound! It seems we are sitting in an actual movie theater! Cannot wait to watch the big game sunday night against the Giants! Go Birds!!,0
I bought this headphone today,0
I have been a Bose customer since my QC2 which came out over a decade ago. The boothtooth is amazing(No other headphones pair and stay paired so well). The battery life is fantastic. THEY TALK TO YOU. Not one complaint. Worth the money. My QC2's lasted forever and hopefully these do too.,0
If you use a TIVO connected to your TV,0
Bought  the orange one first it exactly what I was looking for,0
Excellent,0
After listening to the speakers I was amazed of the sound that was produced. I am currently using them for my turntable and cassette player. This is a big upgrade for me (use to use $40 speakers). These speakers are great for the price.,0
wow what can i say i've always been the one bigger is better but these polk speakers has stopped me in my tracks you will not believe the sound these small speakers put out! i'm hooked for life thanks polk for such great speakers..,0
My second JBL subwoofer,0
I was given one as a Christmas gift. My first wi-fi/blue tooth speaker. I gave one to my son as a gift. Over all sound is really excellent and the bass is also great.,0
Recently purchased for a large living room for AV.  Its the prime speaker system in a 5:1 configuration.  Musically accurate and efficient.  Like the solid construction and looks.,0
I was looking for something compact and Bluetooth capable to pair with my iPhone. I use it at work and on the road. Great battery life and surprisingly good sound for its size. Another great product from Bose.,0
I bought this yesterday and connect bluetooth with my Vivo v5 having a bluetooth version 4.0 The sound is unstable and got stuck frequently. Is this the problem between both (JBL GO 4.1 & My phone 4.0) the Bluetooth version?,0
Just loving it!! It is the best and now it has also received the JBL Connect+ software update. It sounds awesome feels awesome and dirability is just remarkable!,0
Battery life is amazing,0
I love how it looks and the sound of my music. I hate that it isn't wireless and I have to remove my phone case every time I use it. I wish that they had thought this through a little better,0
I fully enjoyed using these to listen to my music,0
Great price for this terrific headphone. The reason for not getting 5 stars is because 1 week after I bought this the price dropped to 1/2 of what I paid for.,0
Fantastic sound,0
"Awesome sounding speakers!! TV and movies has not been same since I bought these speakers...Hooked up in basement to my Yamaha AVR and 52"" LCD TV and its's just like being at the movie theater--except the sticky floors! Highly recommend!",0
I purchased a pair of these in addition to the LSi/ center,0
This thing rocks. Only one thing I could say is that when you turn it up really loud it gets a little distorted,0
I travel for a living,0
another fine polk product. Terrific build quality. Clear deep rich non-muddy bass. Looks great sounds better!,0
I bought this speaker couple of months ago and the sound quality is best and bass as well before i had a sound link colour that was good as well and i really like bose stuff.,0
Charges literally in ten minutes. Does not fall out when running/sweating,0
Been using for a month and absolutely satisfied. No more wifes snoring for me. I am back in the same room. These are a great product,0
I bought this for my son for a christmas present...he had a pair of wireless but they broke a few months after using them... When i ordered these i thought they were wireless but they weren't...he still likes them,0
Well I was shopping around for some sounds for my Mac,0
Best purchase I've made from a retail store in a long time. I was hesitant due to price but it's been an awesome sub. Hit hard and loud when needed and the auto feature works perfect.,0
I went to a retailor intending to buy Infinity 6X9s..Until i heard these!!!They have amazing clarity of sound while being able to take as much power as you want to give them.  They sound even better on my VTX motorcycle!!! Oh yeah they are Marine grade :),0
Had the speaker since Christmas and have had no problems at all. Absolute great product. Had a few Beats speakers in the past but they don't come close to the quality of Bose . I recommend this to everyone looking for a great speaker.,0
The Invoke is one of the best speakers of its kind I have ever heard. The shortcomings is with Cortana. Though Cortana is one of the best voice AI out there the associated software is weak with limited options compared to Alexa and Google.,0
These tower speakers are amazing. They have the best clarity and pureness of sound I have every heard in a consumer speaker thus far.,0
Happy I bought this but disappointed that it did not come with s plug!!  Only came with charging cable.,0
I am enjoying putting this system on when I watch movies or play games. My daughter is able to enjoy it as well as it doesn't blast her out of the room but it makes her feel like she's at the theater,0
Bose have done great job !very nice headphone with excellent sound quality and comfortable with ears,0
Great quality sound,0
Just bought it a week ago. Tested for 1 week and on the speaker listening to music and sleep from 10.30pm till 7am,0
I have been using these for a good chunk of time now and I have been overall happy my only problem is the ear muffs tend to break at the seam I stitched them 3 times and they are starting to discebtigrate other than that they are amazing headphones,0
I received my sample as part of The Review Club and it is amazing!  Base Soundlink Micro Bluetooth Speaker delivers quality sound in a small waterproof package. Perfect for any and all activity. I highly recommend it!,0
My son tried his friends & love them! They came highly recommended and were much less then other brands for the same product. Christmas present!,0
I've had my Bose Soundlink Mini for a year and it has impressed everyone of my friends that have heard the quality of sound this impressive powerful little speaker kicks out.,0
I have had my unit for twenty years now and it still works perfectly and gives fantastic sound. I recently had to purchase a new remote only because my Bichon puppy chewed my original remote.,0
All good except 1thing. Need to reduce the amount of ambient noise that is picked up by the mic during a call.,0
Really nice,0
Strong,0
this is one of the best speakers i have ever had. its small and portable but has great sound. also has good range. works great with my ipad.,0
These are the first speakers I have had to buy in years. So far they are living up to all my expectatins.,0
Overall these R10's are a geat addition to any surround sound center. They deliver sound that can not be matched by any speaker that is in this class. For a 100 watt speaker I challenge anyone to (of course depending on your budget) to find a speaker that will hold a candle to this little jewel.,0
I think find them to be awesome. Light weight,0
I bought this at the beginning of my Spring Semester. It was a great product that is super easy to use and connect to and easy to carry around. Apart from being easy to Cathy around the sound is great! It definitely lit up my past semester with amazing music!,0
I have been looking for a system that will give me the same quality of the movie theater. This system is it. I love everything about this system. Easy steps up. I would definitely recommend this system to all of my friends,0
I was able to get this on special for $108 - shipped - so I am delighted with this product.  Not sure I would have paid the full,0
I am an extremely satisfied customer of the QC25 and have been enjoying the quality music from this product for over 2.5 years. However looks like the cushion life is only about 2+ years as I see the cushion peeling off and splitting.,0
I picked this speaker system up at a Bose outlet in San Francisco in 2000 and attached it to a 200 CD turntable. The sound is incredibly clear,0
belive it or not i got the r40s for free and i couldn't be happier,0
We got a Bose Bluetooth speaker,0
I got this last year and it has worked great! it has been in my shop and can get very loud if you would like and the sawdust does not clog the speaker like other portable speakers. The bluetooth works very well.,0
I have looked for earbuds that don't fall out when I run and I found them. Sounds is good and they can handle the sweat.,0
I love this radio and the fact that I can use it as a DVD player also.  The documentation needs work and made me very frustrated trying to connect multiple devices that need s-video cable.,0
The sound is better than expected. Snug fit as well. I used them while doing yard work and they never came out of ear.,0
I found it as an excellent product and purchased. It is excellent to connect with hand held devices like phones and ipods.... and the sound quality is great...  I would like know that whether it can connected to personal computers or note books having Bluetooth facility...,0
only 500 watts RMS but if you build the right box they have very nice output! Have two of them in a shared chamber ported enclosure. Very accurate subs that would probably sound stellar in a sealed box,0
The sound is impeccable. Bass is top notch for the size of the speaker,0
I bought this direct from JBL as they offer DPD Tracking/Courier and if you sign up for newsletters before you purchase anything you should get a 10% discount code.   This protects my Pulse 2 really well. It's a hard shell and I'm sure it'll withstand my suitcase over the next few months.,0
I bought these earphones one month ago. They give me clear sound when I am in the GYM working out.  Money well spent,0
absolutly great. A sales person at another store was trying to talk me into buying eclipse speakers which is a nice speaker but my money limits demanded good sound at an affordable  price. so went looking. Cicuit city and was totally amased at the sound quality of theses,0
"I had a set of these for 3 days to demo and was blown away by the sound.  My full review is available in the Polk Forums (the link's at the top of the page).  Just look under ""Speakers"" for ""[Review] LSiM 703 Review"".  It's completely worth your while to find the thread and read it.",0
A perfect fit for Pulse 2 with high quality materials. I'd not consider alternatives,0
Overall great. Great sound quality. Fits my head and ears perfectly,0
The sound quality is second to none. The more I increased the volume the clearer the sound,0
I could not have asked for anything better .. Convertible owner and this is the BOMB !! Not only takes calls,0
Jbl sent me these for a replacement on my S500 which had a wire problem. Love the sound with the rechargeable battery The headphone case is very difficult to arrange,0
Not too impressed with the tones for guitar. My BAT Pharaoh smokes this pedal. However,0
Great speakers,0
The surround sound is excellent.  More sound in the rear that I have heard before.  I was amaze of the sound it produces.,0
Listening to Pandora now via iPhone and couldn't be happier. Easy set up. Set up 2 iPhones and an iPad to work with it. Great sound,0
If your looking for a sleek aluminum body with great sound you should differently get the bose soundlink mini if its for indoor use or outdoors it packs great quality sound,0
My grandson got one for Christmas and as soon as l heard it I knew I needed one for myself. Warren Zevon sounds great on my JBL Clip.,0
The speakers sound great until i turn my pioneer head unit to about 40 when they start to distort when more bass punches. But for 6 1/2's they are great i have 1 in each door of my 1999 chevy blazer. All i need is an Amp for my woofers and ill let the speakers go vocal then they will be perfect.,0
I was blown away with the improved sound quality over my old earbuds,0
I use this in my car with my Nexus 5 every day to and from work and it is great. Sound is excellent,0
If you run it at 3/4 to full volume battery only lasts for about 6 hours. I still comment to my wife how much I love it sounds great. Not slot of base but just right,0
Compact easy to use with great film and stills. Even a child could use it. Reasonably priced and fits nicely in a bag or handbag. Can capture those memories easily . Easy to follow instructions guide you through step by step,0
Purchased it using a gift card. Love the ease of setup. Able to stream music from our phones. Would recommend it to anyone,0
When wearing this headset you can not hear anything else,0
Before I bought the SoundLink mini I looked on YouTube at the comparisons between other branded blue tooth speakers through my Bose Bluetooth headphones it sounded to good to be true . But the crisp sound and the lower base tones are phenomenal for the size of it .highly recommended,0
I actually work for a company that sells Polk Audio,0
Awesome Sound and Great Comfort Perfectly fits the ear and no pain even after use of hour. Sound quality is very good. Perfect choice for music lovers.,0
It's amazing how a little speaker can put out so much sound from a mobile my tablet leave it to Bose's,0
Bought these an year and a half ago and they did not break a sweat from preforming so well,0
I integrated these loudspeakers in my home-theatre: all perfect. Now I can listening music without sub too. -Bye fron Italy!,0
Perfect bass and sound and fits on your ears perfect. Amazing was going to buy beats by Dr.Dre. But im glad i picked JBL keep up the good work guys,0
Best headphones used to date. Excellent sound with a good distribution of the sound between right and left.,0
My 15 year old son put this on his Xmas list last minute. I ordered figuring it ma yor may not make it on time. BOOM! On time,0
everyone around me has bose outdoor speakers and when they heard my polk at my last party they could not believe how much better the polks sound. i also have lsi25 inside with the big center. running with a yamaha z-9 wow!!!,0
Cannot believe sound quality,0
Design fits and stays in place during the whole workout. The sound quality is amazing which only Bose can produce. This product is a must for all activities!,0
I was looking for some rear speakers a had blown an omi speaker,0
I was already familiar with this system (and other Bose systems) because a fellow musician whom I play with has one. After hearing how nice his system sounded I had to purchase one for myself. I'm happy I did and I enjoy the heck out of my L1 Model II w/B2 PA system!,0
You can't go wrong with any JBL sub. The best subs I've owned hands down. JBL kills the competition in every way.,0
Love,0
Great noise cancelling,0
Well I just got my speakers and they are better than expected. Check out and Blue Ray movie and prepare to be blown away. My IPOD and Yahmaha AV works so well with these speakers. Now I'm ready to buy the TSI200 to complete my 7.1 home system.,0
I usually buy the sound blocking earphones,0
So amazing! The quality exceeds expectations. Got this as a present and I am so happy with it. I play it at low and high volumes and at high volumes there is no sound distortion. Never bottoms out. Great bass. I would recommend it totally. I am a DJ and I always carry this speaker.,0
our 14 years old so told me:  easy ordering,0
Just installed a couple of weeks ago,0
Top product from JBL again this is my second one,0
I bought these earbuds 1 week ago and I was absolutely amazed with the sound quality and it fits very comfortably inside the ear for long listening periods. Hands down the best earbuds I’ve ever bought,0
B this knowing my previous Bose products impressed me and this no different. The bass comes out the lower back of the unit and you can enhance the great sound even more if you place the unit in a space that reflects the sound of the bass. I'm impressed!,0
Bought it to play music on the beach while on vacation. Well there was a lot of compliments and I noticed more and more chairs gathered around us. I only heard can you turn that up. Great quality and great price.,0
We thought we got the best speakers we could have gotten,0
i am so thankful that polk momo came out with a 4x6 it has really made my life easier in finding a good speaker,0
I like it. Does the job well. I've yet to encounter a jbl product that wasnt of at least decent quality.,0
after my dog eat the charging cable,0
These are an upgrade from QC35 for me. I have the Bose app installed on my iPhone 7,0
Great set,0
I got this speaker for my wife to use on her phone,0
For such a tiny speaker it has great sound and even some bass. Very impressed with the battery life. It ran for the full 5hours that it describes.,0
I purchased the Flip2 to use in my golf cart. Sound quality is amazing & output is so good I can only play music @ half volume without disturbing anyone! Will be on my Christmas present list for sure!! Thanks!!,0
i bought these a week ago and found that the over ear version of these sound much better they much more comfortable if you going to spend all this money spend it on the over ear do your self a favor,0
Was looking for a good quality low priced headphones and these are perfect,0
I bought the sound link earphones for my 91 yr. old husband about a year ago.  He has totally enjoyed wearing them.  He just asked me how I could reattach on ear cushion.  The cushions don’t seem to be worn out.  Can you help me?,0
There are my first headphones that I've used. The sound quality is just outstanding.....  No words to explain the awesomeness of these headphones,0
Great for local sound. I was looking for something for talk radio,0
This is my 2nd JBL speaker and this is an upgrade from the flip. Good bass,0
I buy nothing but Bose and this one have been so far the best ever yet. Better sound ,0
I get my new JBL headphone,0
I was given this speaker because of a family tradition,0
First things first,0
Absolutely love the sound on these. App is very user friendly. Only issues I have at all are the firmness of buttons.,0
Got these as a treat for myself while doing some out of town work.  The charger case is a great bonus. There simply amazing there great full sound and clear without being ear drum busting loud.,0
I had my Acoustic Wave for 3 years now and it still sound like it did from day 1. And with the 5-CD changer it ROCK all day long...,0
Set up was ok. Alittle lengthy but it works well once it's set up. Sound is excellent for such a small unit. People are constantly looking or asking where I put the subwoofer. Overall,0
I bought these to boost the output from my laptop and what a boost it was. The only thing I would change is adding a little longer pigtail which I have done already. Great little speakers.,0
Love the Soundsport earphones,0
I just put these in my back doors to compliment my DXi6500,0
I got this a week ago,0
My wife bought the Flip 2 for herself....I had to snag this little jewel. The sound quality is beyond what I expected out of a small package. You can crank it up and not hear any distortion.,0
I bought this for my office at work. It's perfect.  Sound quality is great -- soft or loud,0
After posting a question on the Polk Forum as for which speaker to use as our rear center,0
Easy to link to iPad using Bluetooth. The sound is amazing,0
i really enjoy to buy this Sound touch for my room. its very clear n nice beats music system. i really satisfied with this product.,0
I am a very recent user of the Soundsport pulse but from the moment I powered on the device,0
The sound is good but I wish there was a remote to control the bass BUT ITS WORTH THE MONEY ITS BOSE WHAT DO YOU EXPECT,0
Bose is still best in the audio section and this device proves it once again. Connects seemlessly with all mac products..and then gives an amazing musical experience..i am loving it..,0
I bought this about a month ago and i am so happy that I did. I really enjoy listening to it as it can be heard over my entire home if I want.,0
What an innovation?! This cutting edge wearable is incredible. Everyday I come up with another use for this great device. Have to start buying them as gifts!,0
I bought this last month and i can feel and see the difference between the built in tv speaker! Its amazing the new bose sound bar!,0
fantastic sound quality and clarity,0
This is the best speakers I had so far.I connected my Laptop and to TV at same time.The sound more than I need :),0
absolutely awesome!,0
I love this company and products. I have had a BOSE Wave for a few years as well as two tv sound systems. Had issues with separate CD Changer. BOSE customer service is unparalleled. Both times my unit was fixed even out of warranty. This senior citizen says THANK YOU BOSE!,0
Even though speakers like the Charge and Charge 2 and much better lower ranges due to their larger subwoofers,0
This has a well rounded sound at any volume level and setup was a breeze. It amazes me that such a compact package can satisfy with so much ease!,0
I love my JBL flip 4! It has great sound and I love that it is waterproof. It doesn’t not die that quickly! The only thing i wish it had is a better connection. Whenever I walk into another room it starts disconnecting and sounding scratchy,0
In the beginning i thought custumer reviews can only be self-advertisement at Polk’s homepage. I’m disappointed positively. My RTi6 beggars B&W,0
i have used this mic with my canon camcorder to record lectures and it does an excellent job. sound quality is great. i highly recommend it,0
I have used my L1 compact for some time now and find it indispensable... I play the accordion playing the base though a midi and right hand through internal giving a fantastic sound... I just love the sound it makes...,0
Just bought today. Unbelievable sound. BT works flawlessly. I can go upstairs and leave my phone downstairs and it stays paired. YouTube,0
Just got this a few days ago and I absolutely love it. Great design,0
I am delighted with the sound system I purchased for my husband. The room is filled with an excellent cinema-style surround sound. Thanks to the keen and expert sales staff.,0
"I listen to very ""complex"" Jazz",0
Excellent quality unit,0
Got it on release date and was not disappointed very great sound bass hits deep and low when it should clarity of vocals are amazing I might buy another one,0
I bought this about two weeks ago and it works exactly as I had hoped. Excellent for the price. Why spend more for noise cancellation if you mainly use it at home?  I do wish it had some padding in the top of the headband. That’s the only fault I can find with it!,0
This is fantastic,0
I have had this for awhile and it still works great. It is easy to take with me wherever i go. Highly recommend!,0
Sound Quality is a lot better than expected in this tiny size. Baterry life excellent. So easy to use you don't need a manual just plug and use as a regular bluetooth device with no passcode.,0
Super comfortable and light weight and sporty looking. Works great at the gym. Able to leave phone in the locker unless I  go too far away. Large gym - so have to take it with me at times. But worth it.,0
Very impressed. Amazing sound,0
"Bought a speaker of the ""other"" brand",0
For the price i expected a lot better as far as volume of the headset is concerned. they are very comfortable and does cancel a lot of exterior noise out but they are not as loud as i expected the cheaper version of these are actually louder in my opinion.,0
I am overall pretty happy with these Soho Wireless headphones... Only issue is,0
I have had this speaker for a while,0
These earphones are not as sporty as the JBL Reflect Mini BT.  The Everest has a harder shiny plastic case for the controls vs the Reflect Mini is more softer. Sound quality is about the same for both and no deep bass,0
Great set of headphones,0
I got this and it's just amazing for everything i do it is the most perfect headphones i'va ever had.,0
I love everything about this speaker the only thing is it's not charging anymore. I bought another charger and still nothing.,0
These subs are nasty! I have 3,0
Hi,0
Used primarily for Audio-books in bed to get rid of the speaker wires. It is fantastic. For its size the sound is truly pleasant. The price of course makes it so,0
I've had these for a few months and I'm really glad I bought them. The sound is balanced with really good fidelity,0
this sub-woofer has good performance for its value. hits hard but my be a little under powered. which is why i ordered another one to solve that issue. waiting for it to arrive and once i get it set up i will do a followup review,0
I love it coz of its comfort and it never fell. I bought a second one for my wife as she like it too.,0
LOUD LOUD LOUD AND CLEAN AS A WHISTLE. SO CLEAR . I HAVE A OLD RELIABLE PRO LOGIC (HAD THIS PUPPY FOR NEARLY TEN YEARS) AMP BRIDGE PUMPING JUST 600 WATTS AND MAN OH MAN DOES THING KICK.  UNBELIEVABLE LOVE IT. BETTER THAN MY MTX SUB BY FAR.,0
This product is great with any type of workout. The only feature it's missing is to skip to the next song.,0
The noise cancellation is beyond belief,0
bought it on sale for 55$ its so good i wish i bought a second one so i could have two different angles of music. I highly recommend this product,0
This little sub bumps really good! I would recommend this product to anyone on a budget looking for a good sub woofer. Jbl products are excellent quality and performance.,0
Bought this several months ago. Love the sound and bluetooth. However,0
It is odd that Bose that makes excellent wireless headphones and they do not connect to the Soundtouch IV. I just don't understand it.  What gives Bose??,0
I purchased two of these,0
Amazing sound,0
These speakers at the best in the market..These Polks put out clean,0
I think it's only fair that when compairing speakers one should categorize it based on price. And theses speakers,0
I bought this used from a friend for 10 years ago (2008) and have used it in all my cars since. Yesterday i installed in my newest car,0
Great quality,0
I agree with most owners about the sound,0
One of my sleep bud had a charging issue and the Bose people went above and beyond sending me a replacement.  I am always impressed when excellent service combines with what I think is an excellent product. Thanks.,0
I use these for the gym and runs all the time. Really good at staying in even if you're doing squats/burpees/sprinting. Although they are a bit larger than you might want they have amazing sound quality so it makes up for it.   Would reccomend!,0
I have never connected with computer since i bought,0
The first one went to our business,0
This item is very compile tart to my flat screen. The sound is an upgrade from the speakers in my tv. I am happy with the product.,0
had them for a few hours and there making a fuzzy noise don't know if its my receiver or the speakers,0
It was awesome until I played 528hz tone for several hours. It got really warm. The next day any bass causes to speakers to distort. I think the voice coils melted. Not sure if this is what to expect from playing single frequencies. Going to try an xtreme and just not turn the volume all the way up.,0
Love the headphones and their audio quality. Would be a five except for a few things: Limited Android controls for the price I would expect to have the same functions as Apple. Also noise reduction allows too much high pitched noise in like baby crying on plane.,0
although it is small there is a lot of sound although not a far range for bluetooth but may just be my phone! holds up with battery although i never know when its fully charged,0
After ordering,0
I have had these for twenty years and they have been great. Extremely durable and nice,0
I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend,0
The Blume so many of the “cheaper” adaptors on Amazon or eBay (that actually cost more) these Bose adaptors never crackle or hiss and attenuate the sound perfectly,0
Pounds great...bought 2 db 12's and the polk audio ported box. Hits the notes pretty good looks great also.,0
This is not a large speaker but the sound that comes out of it is amazing. Has good bass and easy to use.,0
I bought this to use for bass but it’s not my cup of tea however it's a great pedal because each knob has a frequency adjustment below so you can really fine tune the amount of treble,0
I bought my mother this radio 3 years ago. She has had NO problems with the radio or the CD player. She keeps it on 24 hours a day 7 days a week and has had NO problem what so ever. She says that this is the absolute best present she has ever gotten.... Hats off to Bose!!!!,0
Bought 1 week ago for sons birthday and depending on how you turn the cable depends on which side you hear music.  Cannot hear sound out of both ears.  Very disappointing.,0
I bought the xtreme about a month ago. I am very pleased with it as it has a very good amount of bass and also treble. The only thing with the xtreme that i want is more colour variation,0
My cousin gave me one of these for my birthday and it is like have a complete symphony in my hand! I love it and had to buy one for him,0
product is good   good sound good colors looks durable gave to granddaughters they enjoyed them     however order  messed up messed up,0
I bought the product a few months ago and I have to say that these are the best headphones I ever had,0
Great sound for the price and easy installation.  You can easily do all your surround sound speakers using these Polks.,0
Just got these yesterday and I really like them. They have great sound quality,0
I commute 1.5 hours to my gf's which leaves my ears buzzing from constant wind noise as well as my bikes exhaust / pipes. These saved my hearing!,0
I purchased this speaker for my son for Christmas. He loves it and takes it everywhere.  Great sound and easy portability with case. Nice compact speaker with high output.  No issues with connectivity.,0
These headphones are amazing! I hear words and music I have never heard before. Bose has another winner. My only issue is the neck band tends move. They are extremely comfortable and after awhile you don't realize it's their.,0
My partner brought these about a month age and they has changed the way she goes to sleep. They have helped her to fall asleep quicker & longer. Thoroughly recommend this product. Only thing is the ear buds need a few inbetween sizes to guarentee a good comfortable & snug fit.,0
I love love love this,0
I loved it so much i bought my two daughters one and also my son inlaw and we're all very happy with the sound and value,0
Have had this for a while. Gives great sound for TV,0
Great product,0
I got this for a birthday present and I am pleased with the sound quality. My old Bluetooth speaker would fade in and out and this thing does not!  I can walk upstairs with my device and music keeps going in our old house. The range and quality are surprising!,0
I bought this sub to go with my KEF Q70's. It blends perfect. I was stunned when I saw the price,0
Great speaker.  Cool light effects.  Not sure that the color camera is all that great but I love this speaker!!,0
I have had this center channel for about a year and a half and it is absolutely amazing!  It has been put through the test with hundreds of movies and tons of music.  Along with all my other polk speakers,0
I use these for audio for exercise videos or games. They sound good especially considering what I paid. I bough refurbished and have observed no flaws. Some people get annoyed with a power saving mode but I always power off when done so haven't even seen this in action.,0
I have had this mic for about 4 years now and it is wonderful. I originally went to buy a Shure,0
"I have had this subwoofer for a month or so and it proved to be a great buy especially at $199. I have an older JBL 12"" sub that lasted 10 years.",0
I recently purchased 2 sets of the Polk MOMO 5x7s for my Ford Ranger and i put them on a Precision Power 4 channel amplifier and man do they sound great. If you would like a comparsion,0
This is a fabulous speaker. I was able to get a pair on Newegg for $100 shipped last year. Glad I did as Newegg shows them discontinued now.,0
I just bought this yesterday,0
I bought this little  box  for my daughter.  I loved it so i bought one for ourselves Thes sound is amazing  An the price awesome Just cant be beat,0
I have been waiting for this day to come and here it is. Thank you Bose!!!!!! Bought these yesterday when they hit the store and they are everything I was expecting and then some. Very very comfortable and great sound. Bose has done it again!!!!!!,0
Everyone who has seen me using this has asked what brand and where I bought it from. The sound is crisp and the bass does not let up at full volume. Very impressive for a portable speaker.,0
I bought this speaker couple of weeks ago,0
A superb piece of equipment,0
Very good little speaker with a great price!  You will be pleasantly surprised with how loud and clear this speaker is.,0
I bought these for Christmas and they are just fantastic. For the sale price,0
I HAVE OWNED THESE FOR OVER 25 YEARS SDA SRS AND I STILL MAKE MY FRIENDS JEALOUS EVERYTIME  THEY HEAR THEM. OUTSTANDING AND MUSICAL.,0
I brought these around 1 to 2 months and I've never had earphones with such amazing sound quality. Very good bass,0
When it comes to sound  JBL to me is the best.  The cinema sb350 is a good sound bar and the subwoofer is perfect.  So sound and and price is good.  My only problem is the remote control ,0
Have had them for 2 months and are really happy with the quietness of the noise cancellation. Sound from the TV 12 feet away is not noticeable while reading a textbook.,0
These came about a week ago and I have used them quite a bit. The sound is awesome and the fit is even better with the different size of your pieces that are provided. Great job again bows! I have owned a Bose wave radio alarm clock for over 20 years and it has never failed me,0
Overall they sound really good,0
After unboxing and using nesr instantly out of the box,0
I have had the Bose SoundTouch for 3 weeks  and am  delighted with it,0
I have had this speaker for about two weeks now (reviewing for a product-review company),0
Recently purchase from amazon i am still wondering how these pair of headphones are able to block amount of noise seriously.Hats off to Bose team Keep inventing and delighting us.,0
got these as a gift for myself  I work long hours and i've never found wireless that have a battery that will last long enough these fit the bill,0
It brought new sound to my old LP's. Very nice sound. Much better than my other cartridges in the same price range. 4 mv output is little to low for my vacuum tube amps,0
"BEST 8"" FOR THE MONEY! I HAVE TWO IN A PORTED BOX IN MY SOUNDROOM AND THEY SURPRISE SOMEONE EVERYDAY. THIS SUB IS MY TURN TO PIECE FOR ANY QUALITY SYSTEM. AN UNBELIEVEABLE BUY. I HAVE INSTALLED THEM IN ALL COMMON CARS (CHEVY",0
1 week into using these and they have revolutionized the quality of my sleep. I am sleeping better,0
What a great sounding speaker! I have a fairly decent size yard and these fill it with high quality sound. Replaced a set of old in ground speakers that sounded good and with the 51's I just realized what i was missing,0
These are the clearest speakers ive ever heard,0
I bought it a couple of days ago and I love it !! It has great sound for such a little speaker. It paired up to my I Pad and I Phone without any problems and so far so good. I am very happy with this speaker. I don't know why some people are leaving bad reviews !!,0
Great system,0
I purchased these speakers refurbished by Polk and they sound excellent and look like new. Very easy to install,0
We love this but is it normal that it came with the cable but not the charger?  Do we need to go out and buy the charger?,0
Amazing,0
This headpfones are good,0
Got this item for my wife for Christmas,0
I bought this headset today and it makes work in the office so much better. The noise cancelling get’s rid of conversations and noises that can be distracting. The advanced features such as Google Assistant and notifications are a nice plus. These by far are the best headphones I have ever owned!,0
Love this speaker. It synced immediately with my IPod and IPhone and the sound is great. Beautiful sound and so portable.,0
Don't let the price intimidate you. While you may be able to find some competing brands...none will come close to the QC35s. They're powerful,0
bought 1 last month so happy and bought 4 more. Play everywhere feature fills my home 1 acre with no sound distortion problems. BOSE is BOSS AND THE BOSS IS ALWAYS RIGHT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,0
I like this line and have 2 of the original JBL GO speakers as well as a new JBL GO 2. No place for a strap on GO2 and I actually think the original sounds better.  I am sure JBL GO 3 will have a strap in the box when it comes out.,0
i have purchased this speaker last wekend at premium sound of alpena michigan and i have to say this is the best speaker i have ever bought.,0
I've had these speakers for two years and they ROCK! Great highs,0
IGOT MY HEADPHONES FOR CHRISTMAS,0
Purchased a pair of these at Best Buy for fronts in a surround system and I was quite happy with the sound until I heard the Energy C-100s which blew the Polks clean slap azz out the room and I returned them for the Energy's and saved $80.,0
So happy with the new JBL Charge 3! The bass is a bit deeper than the Charge 2. Extremely satisfied ☺️,0
I use  this in preschool for music with 20 children — outside and in.  The sound has depth without distortion.  The volume is excellent!,0
I've been staying with this brand because I like the quality,0
I am happy who buy this sound bar because is very simple,0
I am so happy I bought 4 of these when they were on sale for 50% off as they are the BEST speakers I have ever had!!!  Top notch quality and such clarity,0
I bought one of the refurbished version one month ago. Everything works fine in the speaker but only when I connect it with AUX cable. The speaker doesn't sound good and the music is intermittent when played via bluetooth of my phone or laptop.,0
hooked up flawlessly.  Sound isn't as big as flip but love having USB charge option and pocket size.  The JBL logo is the most important thing to remind me why I have big vintage JBL speakers.  It works!,0
WOW,0
These are nifty headphones. My son has used them and enjoys them. I personally like the fact that they won’t go too loud and thus protect his hearing. Stickers are a nice idea. I would recommend this product,0
I got my amp to accompany my four polk audio db component system when hooking it up the wires are covred for a stelthy install. tuning the amp for the speakers was extreamly easy. the friggin things SCREAM with unbeliveable clearity. POLK AUDIO FOR LIFE!!!!,0
Amazing sound but that's to be expected from JBL. I find it handy to have around on my travels & the quality of sound delivered is great.,0
I purchased a used AT2020 USB,0
Iam starting to build a home theatre system...Iam on a budget and with these RC60I's they fit perfectly in my budget and plans....The sound quality is great and the install was a piece of cake..A great sound in a little packeage....No disappointments!!!!,0
How JBL was able to get this level of base and not drown out the mid and highs is a testament to the quality of this product. Love it !,0
i have this center speaker set up with a b w center they sound great together,0
Great for just about anywhere and anything! I love this speaker it's super loud and has supper great base! I am so happy with my purchase! Definitely worth the money!!,0
I bought this as a Christmas gift and liked it so much that I want to buy another for myself. The price point is a little high but the sound quality is worth it.,0
I saw this amp on sale at Fry's.  I bought two.  Hooked up a Polk DB104 in bridged mode and it hits like a hammer.  Nice quality amp,0
Outstanding! The Lsi9's rival the sound of our SDA-2's. Unbelieveable low end for such a small speaker. Probably the best bookshelf speaker you can buy at ANY price.,0
About 8 months ago,0
"I just purchased the Polk dxi400 4"" speaker to replace the stock speakers in my 94' Toyota pickup. They sound very good if they aren't turned up to loud. They're alright though better then stock that's for sure.",0
I have 2 of these they are identical to jbl s3- 1224 which I have also. I like the bold coloring on the never model. Selecting between 2 and 4 ohm depends on your amp set up is great this sub is rated at 500watt rms. It will rock your world. I am running it with gtr1001 amp,0
Love the open environment engineering however if you cup your ears soooooo much sound is wasted due to the poorly directed speakers in front of ear lobes.  You should tweak that and If feasible combine bone induction on the temples and you Willl dominate the market at a price under 500,0
Knocked me on my ass when I heard the sound from theses babies.  Better than my wife overpriced Bose.  Solid good clear sound for my bedroom .Good separation of sound. Very Very happy as always with anything from Polk. Would have gave Five star but see my weakness for the reason.,0
I have been buying Bose for the past five years now,0
The bose soundlink mini is great small but great sound and you can take it anywhere. But how do you know when it's at max volume? I would just like to say don't get the beats pill it's not very good.Which is strange for beats but bose is betterBut overall it's a great speaker.,0
This speaker makes my playlist come to life,0
Was looking for a good quality/price bluetooth headset,0
Bought the QC35s for a trip to Europe and truly worth it! Great for in flight entertainment and poolside chilling.,0
Good quality,0
this has bought happiness to me listening to music while studying and has bought  me comfort to my ears as i listen.,0
Saw it on the website on Thursday. Went to the Bose Store Friday and took the big guy home... Sounds goooood and its loud!!!,0
This is the second pair I have bought. The first ones I lent to my daughter and I did not have the heart to ask for them back. Every child can scream in the plane and I am in my own heaven.,0
A satisfied user here.. It's just that the shape of the 'headband' looks a little weird when extended. The extra cord was not expected but would surely help! :),0
I bought this last year and it's pretty great. The only complaint that I have is that when people call me,0
Received this as a gift and couldn't be happier. The huge sound that comes from it is amazing. The bass is especially good!,0
The sound quality is amazing,0
The sound system is great. The clarity and tone is amazing for this small speaker. This is my third purchase so family do not have to share.,0
Staitioned on a Naval Air Base I felt vibrating in the bench i was sitting,0
I bought these after looking for some headphones for a while and did lots of research .. so glad I didn’t just take the easy option and go for beats. The sound quality is immense I’m delighted with them and a great price too,0
Just purchased on Black Friday,0
I brought this product just week back and installed in Bedroom with Dell HD LED monitor. It feels like Mini Home theatre now. Sound quality is incredible clear and particularly 'Dialogue' feature is perfect for watching serials.,0
I just installed these in the front doors of my 2005 Honda CR-V.  Crutchfield's web site says they will not fit,0
Installed these speakers in a 5.1 surround system with the 255c-LS center channel. The sound is crisp with great presence. The lows,0
I purchased this a few months ago and I LOVE IT! it's easy to use,0
The new designs of QC25 triple black special edition is amazing.....the faux leather coated around the head band is one of the improvement! good sounds,0
Got this set for my 98 AUDI A6,0
A very good center channel for the price. If you have the extra money buy the CSI-5.Very good voice reproduction.,0
I've had this product about a month and have used it a few times now. Not the best sound but not bad either. Fits and feels well in my ears and Bluetooth pairing and functionality is very good.,0
My husband bought these for me. He snores and wakes me up. I absolutely love these. I would give them 5 stars but I would like them to be able to connect with my phone. I fear I will miss emergency phone calls from my elderly mom and sick son.,0
I bought this primarily to be used as a phone headset and find that it's very comfortable with the bonus of outstanding sound when listening to music.  I have been a customer of Polk Audio for many years--their products are well made and packed with value for the dollar.   Highly recommended!,0
Let's keep this simple,0
I loved it the moment i plugged it into my ears. I cant imagine how much i missed travelling without it. Don't hesitate to buy one,0
SB26 is a buy. It does have a flaw. Bluetooth can hook up from another household or your phone at nite. But the sound that comes from this pair is nothing short of mystical. It must burn in. And then you can’t believe it. Serves as a very good audio system with no wiring. Fabulous!,0
Have a sound touch 20 and added this one to my network. The sound is amazing and being able to sync both systems is awesome. Also makes for an excellent alarm clock.,0
great speakers for sound as well as looks. Big difference in sound between my old jmlab speakers. RM85 is much economical package than any other big brands. Kindly have an audition before wrong decission.,0
I bought this a few weeks ago to bring on construction sites (work) in a noisy environment it still sounds great not to mention everyone keeps asking me what type of speaker it is (brand) and where did I buy it so they could get one.  I will be buying another 1 in the near future.,0
So much better than the competitors that have the party feature.  Having two makes a great portable stereo.,0
The JBL Sport Wireless ear buds are some solid earphones. Nice balanced sound with deep bass. The only problem would be the comfort of the tips. I tried every size and it just wasn't working out so I switched the tips with the JBL reflect.  Other then that they work  great.,0
I use the ATH M50 in my home studio for tracking & some mixing when I need to check things closer than my studio monitors allow. The response of these headphones is pretty neutral which translates well for my mixes. Solid build & comfortable for long periods of use. Great product.,0
I bought this for a family Christmas gift. So far we are happy with the sound and looks of the unit. I would recommend this to anyone interested. Very easy fast set up very nice wall mounted bracket included.,0
"Got mine last week and all i can say is ""it's GREAT""...my battery lasted for more than 14 hours and it's worth the price.",0
BOUGHT THIS LAST NIGHT FROM BEST BUY,0
good bass in a sealed box built to the specs. i built a ported box to the specs and it sraight rattles although if you push a little harder with the ported it distorts but lonly slightly.  I can hit the highs and mids beautifuly and the lows are a bit hard to hit but when they do it is amazing,0
The speaker's were easy to install . Works good on my Harley 2012 Roadking. Ijust wish they were a little bit louder. the sound is very good though.,0
Hi I wonder if the R&D department are thinking of upgrading this system. About time to put bluethooh,0
Great sound. Replaced my Sanyo speakers. Sub-Woofer rocks... Great buy for 499.99. Got a good deal for it.,0
Very impressed with the way they perform. Awesome sound,0
Holy sh**! This little speaker great. Clarity,0
I hinted that I wanted a bluetooth speaker (JBL) and got the Bose. Very pleased with the sound,0
I had my speaker probably about three years it had a charging problems twice out of those three years both times I sent it in the Bose and they completely rebuilt the speaker I definitely got my moneys out of it because I used it on a daily basis,0
Got this for Christmas and I use it every day,0
By far the best subs I've ever had.I went to a competition in the city I live in and with a kenwood 1100watt one channel amp i pulled out 145.9db in a 95' jeep cherokee.I used to be a kicker guy but with these subs around its more like kicker who.,0
This woofer is one of the best on the market. It has both great sound and appearance. Polk keep it up Mr.Polk and Staff.,0
I like these the best for the following  reasons: 1.best sound 2. comfortable  3. Noise cancellation  4. Less wires 5. you can wear them (they don't fall out like the sport),0
i have had these head phones for half a year ,0
So far I'm very happy  with unit and features!! Clear,0
I love this speaker cause it pounds and know one knows what it is its cool that people think its a piece of shit when they see it but when they hear it all perspectives have changed    I personally thank polk audio for making such a wonderful speaker,0
I bought these and continue to be happy with the sound - especially the stereo version through the JBL Connect App.,0
I received them for Christmas and put them in myself,0
I received my SoundTrue Bose Headphones on Christmas Eve and they are simply amazing in terms of the overall design and sound. I own a pair of the SiE2i Sport earbuds and they sound great as well. These devices are very comfortable and produce nice bass and clear sound. I will always be a Bose Fan.,0
I am using the ATR-6550 with a Canon VIXIA HF R300 and getting room hiss and a low hum,0
Pricey - but I enjoy this radio more than I anticipated I would. Bluetooth performance is great. FM reception is outstanding. Because of its remote-controlled convenience,0
Makes carrying around the pulse much more convenient and i dont have to worry as much about when hauling around,0
Bought the MagniFi One on sale and it was extremely simple to get going. Simply plug 'n play via an optical cable. Bluetooth was simple also. Not quite as powerful as my mini Bose speaker,0
I received the system within two days of ordering. I downloaded the app to my iPhone and setup took no more than 10 minutes. The sound is amazing. I'm extremely happy with this purchase.,0
I bought this 1y ago and still play beauty,0
I highly recommend it,0
Worth every penny. It's everything I want,0
I got a pair for Christmas and I have to say they are pretty amazing. Sound quality is great and it's super comfortable to wear. I actually forget that I'm wearing them.,0
I used these to replace some HT155,0
Of course the sound and durability live up to Bose standards so no complaints there.  It is a good looking little speaker,0
just installed these babies... unexpected sound...just amazing..clear n loud...awesome Qulaity Product doesn't distort at-all..,0
amazing i have these in a 1998 maxima with a 4 channel mtx amp and a pioneer headunit and they sound amazing love these speakers,0
I was having trouble sleeping and waking up after 3 to 4 hours. Now after purchasing the Bose sleep buds I sleep comfortably all night.,0
This distortion pedal is different than most. The 3 band eq acts like multi band distortion. you can really customize it to your needs.,0
Mate of mine had one,0
Great bass and treble.  Very clear sound at the loudest level. Small powerful.  Water resistant  is great don't have to worry about in any condition. Definitely would buy again and recommended for sure.,0
Being quite a music fan,0
Bought these a few days ago for work,0
I own several charge 3 ,0
I feel real lucky to have been able to purchase these 800i's (Cherry) for $200.00 each. I thank the Good Guys in Eugene,0
Owned these pups over 1 yr/ still sound lovely...............need not even crank to hear all of Ian Anderson........or Mazzie Starr!!!!!!!!!!!,0
great sounding speakers.center channel is on the money,0
I love this little speaker so far! I love that I can just throw it in my purse and take it with me anywhere! Also love how long the battery lasts! Also has a great sound for such a tiny speaker!,0
For its size,0
Excellent crystal clear sound in both directions. I spent a lot of time on the phone for work and for play and  I prefer wired headset because there is no battery to run out as it wireless sets. Very easy to carry in your pocket in the small pouch that comes with them.,0
Ive been using it for a month now and im in love with the base and you can download the app to personalize your speaker also.,0
These have lasted for 18 months using these daily for the gym and commute and even a marathon run. They have seen a lot of sweat,0
Awesome $5 earbud. Took some time to learn how to use the twist lock. I should buy couple more pairs ...,0
I use these as a pair or rear surrounds,0
Have had this speaker for about a month now and have had no problems. I use it on the roof where I work and all my coworkers compliment me on the speaker and also want one. I’ve never had a problem with it dying quickly and the sound is fantastic.,0
This armband makes using my iphone on the go so easy. And its comfortable. I hardly even know its there....,0
I bought these the day they came out and i was instantly blown away. Better than any other truly wireless earphones ive ever tried.,0
Went to Best Buy to buy a Dre Beats Pill. But walked out with The BOSE Soundlink. There was no comparison in the two choices except for price. I LOVE THIS SPEAKER! Even bought my friends one for their wedding present. 5 STARS all the way around.,0
it is the BEST subwoofer i ever had! the sound of the bass is great with music and watching movies. i highly recommend this speaker.,0
"G4IGD0  <a href=""http://knckkprlvgdt.com/"">knckkprlvgdt</a>",0
I bought this 2 yrs ago (second pair). Amazing sound,0
I gave a JBL speaet to my son for Christmas last year. He is away at college and loves to listen to music while he does school work. The speaker is duable,0
it tooka little time to get the tweeter pointed in just the right spot but when i did my ears literally jumed off my head and dry humped the dang thing.,0
I have two pairs of these. They are an amazing price for the sound they produce. You will not be disappointed with this purchase,0
I researched and this one came up with highest rate and positive reviews. I bought this for my partner and she loves it! It is very loud,0
I love the new looks,0
I recieved these and first I listened to my audiobook great sound then while I was cleaning I used them to listen to music sound even better they are comfortable stayed in my ears which I usually have a problem with I will be using these all the time!,0
Just got mine yesterday,0
GREAT sound. Long time Bose fan,0
I bought these because I dropped my Samsung AKG earbuds in water. The quality is not of that of the SAMSUNG AKG but still pretty good,0
I replaced two lx500 JBL speakers that were around 20 years old. I could not be more pleased with both sets they are great.,0
Had it for about 12 hrs and I'm an audiophile this thing rocks the sound quality is A1 thanks Bose nothing can compare love them so much I don't think I'll be using any of my headphones anytime soon,0
Just purchased,0
I bought this a year ago and I love this. I use this every where even while I am working out. It has outstanding battery life,0
The design is great. The weight is ok. The Bluetooth life is amazing! Could have a little bit more bass. Overall,0
I purchased these in 2009 and use them with my Mac.  Never had any issues.  Has excellent sound quality,0
I’ve had this speaker for a while now and I believe it’s the best out there for a great price it does just as well as the beats pill and for a way better price great sound and it can charge your phone!! Even waterproof!! I highly recommend this for anyone looking for a great affordable speaker!!,0
System works brilliantly combined with laptop and iTunes. Sound is much better than my previous hi-fi system which I thought was quite a good sepertate setup! Very easy to set up with wi-fi router and a pleasure to listen to.,0
Love these speakers! I can't keep the music down in my car. I am new to Polk and I am very satisfied with my purchase. Plus,0
I have had many different sound systems thru the years but nothing compares to the sound of a BOSE. Like being on the front row at a concert. If you love music it is a must radio! No other music system compares.,0
i can not find out what the impedance rating is on this bass bin no matter where i try,0
We bought this for our trailer back in October.  We now shuffle it between the trailer and home.   As others have said,0
Like most of the reviews,0
Great product,0
It is huge one of the best sounding JBL speakers around!!  The only flaw is its multi connectivity feature.,0
This is a fantastic set of speakers. Decent bass,0
I bought this from an email I received for only $20.  For such a small,0
I love these speakers. I have 8 in my boat underneath the gunnel and are perfect. I have the size up from these on my house and dock. love these and recommend them,0
The price doesnt always determines the quality. The prices is really good. Only thing is that for me the device feels a bit to tight on my ears. After a while my ears need to breathe,0
Very happy with the sound of the speaker set up. They sound great for both movies and occasionally listing to music. The wall mounts took a bit to mount but the instructions were great on how to. Glad I purchased.,0
I bought 2 one at target the other on line. I've happy with the sound and comfort of mine the other was a gift for my daughter and she called and said she loved hers also,0
If anyone can find better headphones in the same price range I´d be surprised... I listen to all kinds of music and they never disappoint me...,0
It sounds great.  Need to keep device much closer than 30 feet.  I also have bose  301,0
I've just tried them,0
just threw em in the front of my o5 sierra and i love my highs so they were everything i expected well worth the scratch but like the others said dont try to punch em too much mids and highs excellent!!!!!!,0
I bought this one today,0
I just received Soundsport free today ,0
I have only had mine a few days,0
We bought this for our sons nursery when we noticed him stalking Elexa any time she lit up. We've ended up synching to pretty much everything in the house because the sound quality is great and the portability makes it a whole house tool.,0
This is the best Bose speaker so far,0
Bought these bad black boys for my husband because I love my aqua ones for my little ears. Next best thing to my molded in-ears.,0
Very happy with the R30s. I compared them with the NS 7390 and decided to keep the R30s.  They sound great in our large bedroom.,0
"I had these in my last house. I bought them to upgrade a 6.1 surround I already had. I purchased the TC80i for more bass than the 6"" and BOY WAS I HAPPY!!! THese have alot of great mid tones along with directional tweet. no problem fitting between studs. Highly recommend.",0
This is my second pair of headphones from Bose and they just keep getting better and better. Best sounding headphones ever,0
I purchased this for a Father’s Day gift for my husband. He loves this little thing. It is mostly used for our camping trips and while he is outside washing vehicles are doing yard work. Big on sound and got a great price on it.,0
You wont believe its not a floor standing speaker! Amazing sound,0
I just bought this speaker and I didn't compare shop. I just went for it and I'm so glad I did. It's awesome for the size and the sound is great. You and your friends will be impressed. I got mine in orange cuz I don't like to follow the all-black-everything crowd.,0
march of 08 i whent out to look for some speakers i whent into furture shop and found a set,0
wow wow this is far the best of my other bose products the sound from this small speaker is massive wow wow,0
Since moved into a smaller home the old cumbersome stereo surround sound is too large to accommodate I totally like the Bose solo since then I have purchased the Bose headphones and the Bose Mini  I search the site often for new products. I also find the pricing of the products to be fair,0
I love how this sounds for its small size.  It fills a whole room with great music and no distortion. Ive have it for 1 month and   I haven't found anything to complain about yet,0
This little unit packs a punch. Used it all weekend and dust have to charge it. Rich and powerful sounds from a small package. Very please with my purchase.,0
Love the product but less impressed with ordering on line thru JBL web site. Was able to order same product thru different website without difficulty,0
Purchased my Soundlink mini from Currys. Connects easily to my ipod and iphone,0
The module adds so much depth and demension to the sound the sound at 700 offers. The setup was simple and straightforward. I upgraded from the cinemate 120,0
Great rack mount feature allows me to have 6 at the ready. (A.T. Says I'm good for up to 10.) great sound quality. One drawback is that I wish I could swap the capsules to benefit from the frequency response of other A.T. Microphone designs. Stil,0
If you are looking for a decent front speaker,0
This is the best thing since sliced bread and appears to have the full JBL DNA in it.  A fan of JBL for 40 years.  Still own JBL L100 Studio Monitors.  Wonderful quality !,0
I recently ordered this item based off of the customers reviews and I'm glad I did. The connection was easy,0
I just bought two of the MM104's and have the C500s model polk amp is this going to be enough power for two of these subs? will it be under powered? can you do harm to the sub if its under powered? Sorry im just learning. cant wait to try them,0
Bought this speaker as I wanted something for the garden,0
The Charge 3 is top of the line for BT speakers on the market. The sound quality is awesome and the fact,0
I bought this as an upgrade from my definitive 600 8” sub.  And wow what a difference. This thing fills your room with clean bass. It even makes my audiophile surround friend jealous.,0
"I'm very impressed with the sound quality of these speakers. The highs are just ""very detailed"" at low volumes. The bass and the mids come in so nicely. My speakers are in the upstairs bedroom I could feel the bass vibration in my solid oak desk on the 2nd floor of my house. Highly Recommended!!",0
It will be a XMas present for a young woman. Just checked the sound and re-packaged. Surprisingly good sound,0
Eu tenho um par de m40 e CS1,0
This is such a great sounding unit I'am using mostly Apple Air-Play and the details of the music beats my two speaker and sub system. It is like rediscovering my music collection and hearing details In the music I have been missing.,0
I bought this because I needed something small and portable and I was hoping the sound would still be good....AND it is! My son has the slightly bigger Clip and that sounds amazing so I thought I'd give the Micro a shot. Definitely a top ten purchase. (Plus I got it on sale through JBL direct),0
I purchased this as a gift for my husband. I t has great sound and just the right amount of bass. Remarkably convenient size. I'mean buying at least 3 more - 1 for me and 2 for gifts.,0
Great Speakers,0
Also speakers loadest that i can find in stores with clairty. Of course theres is loader sets but for $300 that price is just untouchable,0
I have enjoyed the Bose product line for over 40 years. This was my latest purchase and it meets all the expectations you demand of this brand. Worth the cost light weight to wear all day.,0
My son got these for Christmas and I use them some. The headphones have great quality but the end of the cable that plugs into the device is not durable. While my son was plugging the end into his device the cable end bent slightly and now will only produce sound when you move around the plug.,0
The Bose QC 25 are the most comfortable pair of headphone and the active noise consolation is like nothing else. I would recommend these headphones,0
Bought this for my 2 younger sons in college for Christmas. They started using them immediately. Love it. And because they are active ,0
Had mine from new in 1995. Still sensational after all these years. They were expensive but worth the price,0
So easy to set up.  The universal remote has replaced 4 others.  Great to listen to music whilst watching less interesting programmes.  Sound quality is stunning for the size of unit.,0
They are great headphones,0
"I got these a week ago and I can't be more thrilled with them.  The noise canceling is sweet and the sound quality is great.  The ""low"" setting on the noise canceling is perfect for windy days in the Midwest.  The earpieces are so comfy also.",0
I have 60 series monitors and they sound great. I had in in wall speaker system that cost thousands and these monitors just sound better. These take up a little space but I would buy them again. I have a cs10 center speaker,0
Just bought Bose 35 headphones and the first thing I noticed is they don't go small enough for my head.,0
they are small enough for sattellitle speakers and sound really good.The price is good and the quality is on.I especially like all the mounting options,0
I should have replaced the original speakers when I bought the truck but I didn't. So now,0
I bought the original bose when they came out and now they are in wave 3. The one I own for almost 20 yrs and have been very happy with it. Now it finally broke about a month ago and now I'm looking forward to replace it. 2 thumbs up for bose.,0
Excellent headphones for my three year old to use with his iPad when travelling. Well padded,0
i compared them against the pre sonus HD7 and this AKG´s where waaaaay much better in basses,0
I can't fault this headset (except the head band could be comfier) Its perfectly designed right through the the swivel ear cups.  Fantastic headset. Keep these going Bose. I know everything is going wireless,0
Great speakers. After all these years the Polk 10B still sounds great and the cones are awesome - they don't dry our like most of those others during the time period!,0
I use this subwoofer with my onkyo receiver in my home theater room,0
Bought a set 5 days ago to combat partner snoring and other background radio noise. They worked a treat straight out of the box. Comfortable and effective,0
These are fantastic! I bought 2 for my girls and these are clearly the best sounding headphones yet. Try them you wont be disappointed. Quality product just like I expect fro JBL.,0
These are,0
I'm very pleased with my purchase. The sound quality is great. They are a good compliment to my surround sound system,0
I've had it for a couple months and I'm more than happy with it. I've yet to have a problem,0
This is a pretty cool set of headphones. The best feature are they easy to find volume control buttons. The case included has vented slots to help dry off your equipment between workouts. As you'd expect,0
My husband bought these for my birthday and I love them!  They are amazing and I love the sound selection!  Highly recommend if you are married to a snoring bear!,0
I bought these for a trip and they were great!! I did have an issue with the charging case after 3 months in which I contacted Bose and they replaced them. THANK YOU BOSE!!!  The sleep buds are great and I sleep fantastic with them.  Keep making great products Bose,0
This is the best accessory i got for my Cinemate 130. Really,0
Fantastic Fantastic Fantastic FantasticFantastic FantasticFantastic FantasticFantastic FantasticFantastic FantasticFantastic FantasticFantastic FantasticFantastic Fantastic,0

For the low price,0
Better than Beats.Period. Have never seen better earphones for such an amazing and reasonable price!!!,0
if perfect with my setup. tsi300,0
This is a very nice Hands-free device. The speaker is very nice to have on a picnic etc. Seems well built. I have it on my visor often though the one listening cannot hear me well. Where are the microphone holes ? I HAD 3 MOTOROLA ROADSTER 3'S ALL JUNK THIS IS 300% better.,0
Outstanding speakers!!  I am very happy that I added these speakers to my rig,0
Bought two of these. Sound is great! Put it on the back of the boat while beached and was plenty loud. Bluetooth works very well between each unit.,0
Great warm sound. Silk tweeter is smooth and accurate. Sound is definitely not muddy. A prefer a flat response and the r20's deliver.,0
Pro: sound quality,0
I was on the test group. AMAZING!! Some of the best nights sleep I've had in a long time. Highly recommended.,0
I've had this for over a year now. The sound is INCREDIBLE! It sounds like a speaker many times it's size. I wouldn't even consider buying anything else. Thank you Bose!!!,0
I bought a pair for my girlfriend for Xmas,0
I received this for my birthday mid-july. I have dropped it,0
1st pair of wireless ( due to phone upgrade to iphone 8+) & what a difference in sound quality with these headphones ! Dead easy to pair up with my I-phone,0
I recieved this as a birthday gift and by the rating I gave it,0
Could you please let us know Power Rating of the Sound System. Either 110V/230V ? Is it required any power adapter for 230V ?  Please let us know.,0
This became a speaker of choice for me since my friend introduced me to the brand!!Amazing built and sound quality!,0
I bought this earbuds one month ago,0
Bought this as I found out it was waterproof and after reading great reviews. I wasn't disappointed,0
There earbuds not only lock into my ears better than any other but they have the richness of mids and lows that JBL is known for.  Great product at a great price.,0
This small box pumps out an amazing sound in a tough & durable unit. It's just the right size for traveling anywhere and still maintains that big Bose sound and quality you expect.,0
buy them a few months ago ,0
Had an issue with a my headphones,0
Very fine sound and clear.Has good features.Can use a Charger.Not Excessively haeavy.Extremely well built.I would recommend it.,0
Doesn't sound bad. Fills up a room pretty well without being too loud. Could use just a little more bass.,0
Sounds great and everything but the last one I had I last it 7 years this one just lasted 2 years it keeps turning off,0
I purchased these head phones 3 weeks ago and love them. They have great sound and are easy to use and connect. I highly recommend these.,0
I bought my xtreme over a year ago and its by far the best on the market. I love music and listen to it all the time. I've had other large bluetooth systems and none even come close to the quality of sound the extreme produces.,0
I always wanted,0
Its amazing headphone,0
I got it on 08-04-2013 and noise cancellation quality is excellent.. even in subways u gonna feel like you are at your home and you're listening your music like you are in a quite room..I am totally in love with this product.,0
well what can i say about the bose soundwear i purchased this bose product and when i first heard the sound it was abosolutely stunning,0
Great product to purchase for your child! Adjustable and comfy to boot. The volume limiter is an excellent feature that means their ears are safe. Love them!,0
I have the ST20 in white,0
Never thought I'd get this kind of sound from something this small! Was very impressed with the bass and clarity of this bluetooth speaker. Would highly recommend this product to all looking for an ultra portable speaker system for your phone which is good enough from the living room to a car.,0
"AfXcDw  <a href=""http://qlmiemlivdui.com/"">qlmiemlivdui</a>",0
I got this speaker less than 12 hours ago and I have to say,0
Sound quality is outstanding and I can still hear what is going on around me.  Calls are crystal clear.,0
I bought this mic on sale back in Oct. had an AKG 220 and only bought the 420 because it was on sale. Love it!,0
I have cauliflower ears from wrestling and MMA fighting.  The earbuds with it varing sizes makes it easy fit for us with cool cauliflower ears!  Fear the ear!,0
I have owned these for a year and they have been excellent. I love how small they are,0
Maybe not as loud as we would like - we bought 2 and for a party will probably need to buy a third,0
I love the sound from these!  Bose does not fail to deliver.  I love these!  They are my favorite pair of ear buds.,0
The best feature for me is the fact that it is waterproof and since I live in Florida I am always near water,0
They are very responsive on today's digital receivers and 4 of these match well with my Onkyo TX-NR818,0
Lately I've been watching some reviews online about charge 3 and they say it is one of the best!,0
I got these headphones this Christmas (as I’m writing this it’s December 28,0
Bought these while on sale. Great sound and comfort. Workouts are definitely wireless all the way around. No more tugging or pulling wires.,0
I bought this a month ago and had its first test on the water.   Speaker is very loud and amazingly waterproof    Several people in our groups are getting them so we can link together and have surround sound on lake.  Definitely worth the cost.  100% satisfied. Would pay more,0
I have been an avid fan and regular buyer of Bose products. Simply put,0
earth shaking bass,0
O...M...G... I bought 2 of these speakers and they are amazing. I purchased these with a 760 watt pioneer amp and these hit hard! I was really surprised how good these really were. With the money. Not a fake review I'm 21,0
Hook up was as simple as advertised. If it performs as well as our other 5 Bose purchases we will be elated. Looks great,0
Yes I bought Bose revolve + Bluetooth speaker,0
excellent sub i miss read the watts and ran it at 360 watts to each of the two i had at two ohms very upset when finding out 165 constant was what it was,0
I have had my Bose Bluetooth mini for two months love it They say good things come in small packages. This does and some,0
works exactly like it should,0
This is the best subwoofer that i have owned to date. Doesnt distort at extremely high volumes,0
This Bose mini is exactly what I was looking for.  I can take it in the garage when i do projects,0
There are more functions and it's working great.  I bought this is for my own setup for acoustic guitar record.  I like the new one with the DC voltage input than the low AC voltage of the old one.,0
Holy Crap!!!! These are the best speakers I have ever owned in my life. I never owned Polk before and I will never own anything else. I bought the rti 8's with the 404 sub and it kick's butt.,0
Bought the 700 SoundBar and Bass Module 700  System absolutely CRANCKS!!! Absolutely happy as with it. Just need wireless speakers and Bose home 500 then what a system that will be!!!,0
I bought this product six months ago and it was absolutely worth every penny - it has an incredible range of volume,0
Believe it or not,0
I walk a lot and the headphones really come in handy. Great sound and easy to use without taking them off my head,0
It is the best system Bose invented after some time. The audio is so clear and fill the room with rich music. The one thing I wanted to know if I can connect REAR speakers to the system. I have AM5 cube speakers and wanted to understand if it is possible to connect.,0
I bought this system two weeks ago,0
It is a really great speaker,0
I have owned them for probably 3 years and now I need new cable that goes from one speaker to the other....,0
What can i say ive tried other brands and tp ve honest JBL is boss you won't find a better product I promise you !,0
I purchased these about 2 weeks ago and I must say they are typical of Bose  quality,0
Wanted this kit for years and now my music listening pleasure is complete! Thank you Bose for being so good!,0
I bought these speakers for my pc and I am astonished by the sound performance. For this price you cant go wrong,0
I bought them like 3 years ago and still have them they are the best headphones out there till date and they have the strongest durability I’ve seen.,0
Bought a pair of in ear sound true ear buds and my animal eat the gummy ear piece off can't find them on here spent 3 hours looking.,0
For a speaker that is so small,0
i bought these headphones about a year ago and i am really happy i did. these headphones are lightweight,0
I have tried about 6-7 other high end headphones -- and these are the very best. I can do phone calls with clarity that is terrific,0
I've owned a couple if the original Life styles 5.1 systems dating back to the late 1990's I also own a 3.1 system for gaming. With out a doubt this is their best system to date. Not cheap but you get exactly what you pay for. Customer for life!,0
Great sounds quality ,0
This thing has some serious bump. The Bluetooth signal is strong too. The light show is a bonus,0
I just got mine today and I love it so much I haven't stopped using it! It gets so loud and it's so clear! For the price it's way better than Jambox mini or even the Beats Pill. Pill killer for sure! Must have for portable music lovers!!!,0
What else can I say but WT...!! In my 460 sq ft den this replaces my bulky 5.1 set up with sweet bassy sound. Best part is you can arrange the wireless satellites to accommodate your situation. This will not compete with a full big speaker system but very close for my room. A+,0
great built quality,0
I can't really complain. I got a great deal. But I was expecting wireless because I bought wireless,0
I have a Ranger 31' tug,0
The bass is amazing on this speaker.The sound is amazing.The best part is that you can take it into water.But the best overall is the battery life.I have got almost 3 weeks of usage out of the battery.,0
I run with these now almost everyday. I washed them last night,0
Great sound all around connect to wifi without any problem. Google assistant works good even while playing music at low volumes,0
i bought this 2 days ago and im using weak amp to power it up... and its banging the roof of my car :D,0
Had this unit for  about 2 month's it is superb. The bass on this beauty is second to none and sounds great with all genres of music. Can't wait to build on to this system.,0
I've had two pairs of these headphones so far and I love them. Never fall out of my ears no matter how sweaty I get or what activity I'm doing - running,0
I am very happy with my earbuds. They have lots of bass and are clear but they let it to much noise.,0
I am happy with my purchase. The setting up of the equipment was very easy. The sound reproduction is top class,0
Baught tbis a month ago for myself as a jump start to getting me back into the gym. I absolutely love it. The price was worth it. Very happy.,0
Needed more sound in my work area and this is perfect! Now I can focus on my project without hearing “MOM!” every 5 minutes!,0
This hands free product is what I have been looking for. Where have you been hiding this item. I am totally in love with it.,0
Bought this speaker for home and trainings,0
I purchased these headphones for my lady and she loves them. Great sound and good build quality,0
I added the PSW350 to an Onkyo Component Shelf System with a sub-woofer pre-out.  I was amazed at the difference it made.  I felt that I had to immediately listen to all of my favorite music to hear what I had been missing.  The PSW350 gave me a whole new appreciation of music.,0
I've had this unit for a couple of weeks now and absolutely love it! The sound quality is awesome and I am enjoying all my Christmas and classical cd's. The set up was easy and ordering from Bose was quick and painless.,0
"This amp has more than enough power to push my 12"" subs",0
With Football tailgating season almost here,0
This little speaker paired easily with my devices and delivers a big sound for such a small speaker.  This is not meant to fill a huge room,0
i bought these because i wanted good headphones. i had wanted to go for the beats studio 3 headphones but returned them because they were not good enough. these are great and would recommend them. a bit on the expensive side tho,0
it very nice i say get one and see for yourself you will love it wifi is very good best bose wave soundtouch ever im very happy with my thank you bose,0
I love this unit.  It exceeds all of my expectations.  I wish I had known how good it was I would have bought more as gifts.  By the time it was delivered it was too late to order more at the same price.  The offers need to go about a week longer.,0
Easy to install,0
Overall excellent sound. This is a great solution for a room and house that does not easlily lend itself to wiring rear speakers or mounting them anywhere.  The surround sound is very good and the overall sound quality is excellent.  Easy to hook up.,0
This is a great sub for the money.  Purchased a little over 6 months ago and absolutely love the sound that is given off by this piece of equipment.  I would highly recommend.,0
Amazing earphones I ever had in my life.Today thrown all other earphones in bin I was using since ages. Nothin can beat BOSE is after all Boss,0
I love Bose and I received the expected quality that I wanted. I am a user of their aviation products and love all of them! You get what you pay for.,0
This small Bluetooth Player rattles the dishes in the kitchen when turned over half volume and can be heard anywhere in our house.,0
They offer crystal clear sound particularly at the high range. It means you can hear throbbing bass in trance music. best value for your $$$,0
I purchased my wife the quietcomfor 1series and it came with the airplane adapter,0
Bought these cause I spend a lot of time on a plane and wanted to drown out the noise of everyone on the plane. Was hoping they were as advertised and they did NOT disappoint! Legendary sound,0
For the most part,0
I have both the Qc20s and 25s love them both!,0
These are amazing speakers. Definitely worth mentioning that they can take in more power than they are supposed to. The build quality is top notch.,0
I bought this for listening to music while hanging around on our patio and parties. The sound is unbelievable so clear and the bass is great,0
I’ve been a proud owner of JBL products for years now,0
When I first got these little gems that wasn’t as loud as I hoped but they isn’t made to have sound coming out all the time,0
These are great speakers,0
I've had this speaker system for 7 years now and it is still producing great sound. I've just moved it from the basement to a much larger family room and the subwoofer has no problem filling the area with great bass.,0
Very happy with overall quality,0
Solid build,0
I own a set of Everest 700. Needless to say,0
Just got my speakers last week,0
I received mine as a gift for fathers day (I picked it out of coarse)I love it  it has pretty good bass for such a small package and the batteries lasted me over a month rockin out at high volume levels,0
Simply put these are the best 6x9 speakers i have ever purchased they sound great. People who say the bass gets distorted when you turn them up loud should get a amp and watch these speakers hit like you've got 12inch subwoofers in the back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,0
I bought this last week since then nothing was able to separate us. I love the clear solid sound. Comfortable ear pads. Superb Noise Cancellation feature and light weight. Comes with a hardy carry case.,0
I have one 10 inch polk momo with a 700 watt bazooka amp and this 10 really makes my car shake. I recomend it to any one who wants to put a lot of boom in your car but dont want to take up a lot of space. I cannot keep my mirror straight.,0
I was surprised to listen the quality they produce with Yamaha RX-V675.. I bought it to listen only stereo music which i love. Right now I am listening them no more than -25 db as I live in apartment but I am waiting for time to play them on little bit louder.,0
Good quality and design. Nicely hear what happened around you when you turn music off. (Don't need to take it off for talking),0
Bought these a few months ago,0
I auditioned these at a local Circuit City and they sounded great.  I compared them to a pair of Infinity and Sony towers of the same price and size and a pair of Bose 301's.  The Polks blew the competition away.  I think I'm going to purchase them.,0
I bought these about 2 weeks ago. They sound just as good I expected. The only problem I have with these headphones,0
I received this as a gift and it was very useful it lasted very long and allowed me to protect my phone in a way I felt was very safe and sturdy. More people should know about this because it truly is such a great tool that needs to be used by everyone,0
What a Steal these earbuds are!!!  1st my son got a pair then I had to get a pair for myself once there was a 2nd sale!!!,0
I love it! The sound truly is amazing. Very rich and makes the music sound as if it's live. I am so happy with it and like showing it off to my friends and family. They too are astounded by such terrific sound coming from such a small device.  Get one,0
High tec item Very good sound  Too expensive Wish it was little louder But better qualaty then thier other products,0
As advertised,0
Happy so far with the purchase,0
I bought these as a cheaper travel pair of headphones,0
I dropped mine in the yard about a month ago and I thought after so long,0
I bought two of the speakers for my daughters for Christmas. The sound is great. Convenient to take outside to listen to. We play it in an indoor arena. It is a great speaker with great sound.,0
I bought the filp 3 two months ago and I love it. It's very loud long lasting battery and I love the bass.,0
I had my Earbuds for a Year now and I use them everyday when I am running,0
I thought this would be bigger,0
I have no problem with the ear bugs,0
BEST HEADPHONES EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Im definitely buying my friend a pair for her birthday.,0
I bought it for my PC and tried with my TV as well.  It supports and works really well for TV as well.  The sound is great and really dont want to compare it with any other speakers that I was using for last 20 years.,0
These are great surround speakers for Home Theater.  As mentioned by others they do seem a little wobbly on the stands,0
i love this subwoofer,0
I have had my portable speaker a few weeks now,0
Just bought a pair and buying another one,0
I bought this one 4 months back and now I am facing a charging issue as the white light doesn't stop blinking while getting charged and also the playback time has reduced to 1 hour max. Also ,0
I wanted something small but with a good sound that I could throw in my suitcase. The Flip 2 is just the thing,0
The only thing I don't like about th Quit Comfort 20 is the connection to the phone. After using it my thought is that it should have a straight connection and not at the angle made. Just my feeling. Everything else is great. I like that I can wear it with a hat on a plane.,0
This little speaker can fill a whole room with sound. It's very loud,0
Thought my speaker was ready for the bin but it turned out i just needed a new charger canle! Bargain,0
I used JBL for almost a year and wanted to buy a new set for my husband. The sound quality is amazing,0
Been loving this thing,0
Microsoft need to develop this awesome product. I love my invoke and would love to hear about more things that are planned for it in the pipeline.,0
I got them a couple weeks ago and I was surprised at how comfortable they were. Plus the controls on the headphones are much easier to use than the 300 Everest. And the sound is what you'd expect from JBL - top quality.,0
I had to review these headphones because of what I've put them through and they still give me amazing,0
best portable speaker ever all around sound quality .i got from my son on Christmas best present ever i ride a manual sports wheelchair every day i attached to it and i go every where with it,0
Great feature that it comes with aux cable and protective case. Sound is very good.  Buttons are easy to use and find even with headphones on your head. Comfortable on the ears. My only complaint is that the instructions are in TINY print,0
Awesome product. Never fails to impress anywhere I bring it. Should be on commission as many said they would buy one based on what they heard and what they saw (simple,0
Purchased to replace old speakers and receiver in kitchen.  Perfect.  Fills room with wonderful sound that defies its compact footprint.  Plenty of volume and distortion free even when cranked up!,0
I bought this thinking it would sync with my other jbl speakers for a little extra bass I should have read up a little more. It is a great speaker but for the price I would buy 2 charge2 or 3 plip4 which are excellent in party mode,0
This is the best bluetooth speaker I have ever personally had before,0
Great pair of headphones. Had an incident where one side melted(got too close to a fire) and they still work and sound great! After 1-2 hours of wearing them they can get a little uncomfortable,0
Received this as a Christmas gift. The speaker is attractive and produces clear beautiful sounds. Would highly recommend this device,0
Outstanding sound quality fills the entire room with rich bass sound. AM/FM reception is clear without static or interruption.  amazed by the time every time I turn it on,0
Overall,0
Excellent product great sound,0
Love the around the ear headphones but hate how hard it is to connect the audio cable. The sound quality is superb!,0
Very pleased with the QC30 wireless. Sound quality,0
The first time I experienced Bose was in 1993.This is my second set going on 3 years.Im still impressed.And so are people who come to visit.Wether it's music or a great movie with surround sound.I always get a great comment. Love it.,0
These make a very nice pair of noise-cancelling headphones. I was hoping the wireless feature would apply to the average PC,0
It is a gift for our son who travels a lot. He is a pilot and has the Bose pilot headset. I have the over the ear comfort quiet/comfort and now we have three sets of Bose.,0
Excellent product and price. And the fastest shipping ever. This became the replacement in my Canton sub woofer and it sounds better than ever. I will a consider JBL first before I make any future purchase.,0
I bought these last month on Black Friday and I’m glad I did because they are loud and have noise canceling. It also has good bass.,0
Yes there are limitations,0
bought one of these about six months ago at a bestbuy for $99. i put it in my 98 malibu.  it pounds amazing. i will never buy another sub thats noit polk audio. this thing shook off my rear view mirror hooked up to a jensen 300 watt amp.,0
Great sub. Plays all of my music (mostly electronic) very well. Nice,0
This is so amazing! So much bigger and better than my previous 2 Bluetooth speakers that were stolen. JBL customer for life!!!!,0
I got these about two weeks ago and have used them every day whilst skiing. They are a great fit and stayed in all the time. Perfect for the odd work call I had to make too. I,0
I bought this amp to drive a pair of wake tower speakers. The instructions were clear and concise and set up was easy. This amp provides plenty of power to play my music loud and still sound great.,0
Mounted on second floor deck and the sound up and downstairs is great.  I dropped one off the deck by accident.  It fell at least 14 ft. into the yard and landed on the grill. There was no change in the sound of the speaker! The sturdy grill protected the speaker and took the bounce test just fine.,0
The sound is incredible.  Very easy to use for answering or making phone calls.  I wish it had come with instructions other than a quick start guide  and standard warnings.,0
I've had this product for a while now and I love being able to go hands free when I'm out on hikes or running with my dog!,0
At first everything worked awesome but I’m having a problem when it is connected to the tv and I turn the volume up the sound bar turns the volum back down have been trying to figure out whether it’s the sound bar or the tv,0
Just got these today. Unreal. Crystal clear quality and great bass. It's bose so you can expect greatness.,0
I really like the clip,0
In comparison to my TV audio the Bose delivers improved sound quality which becomes more noticable as the volume increases. If you only ever watch TV - DVD's at normal to low sound levels then you might struggle to discern a significant improvement.,0
I've been buying BOSE for years and this little speaker is upto the BOSE standard,0
this speaker sounds great. it would be cool to have some audio adjustment knobs. one thing to me that sucks is its battery life. good for  play,0
i bought this item before i flew out,0
There is nothing in the world like a Bose.  The BIG sound and the clarity will never be matched.   We absolutely LOVE ours.  It will be one of the satisfying purchases you ever make.  Thank you BOSE.,0
Great microphone. Use with my audio technica wireless system series 2000 and ATW-2110 transmitter when playing my saxophone on gigs. Would recommend to any one thinking about wireless for their performances. Quite affordable and durable.,0
had the 35's for 13 yrs now. have 4 in a HT config. great sounding speaker. low or high vol. add the psw 450 and wow!,0
bought this for the beach and have used it for 2 weeks. used for dusty room renovation too. amazing,0
I.have read several reviews regarding base being too light... I disagree.  I will admit I primarily watch Netflix but the clarity and bass is excellent.  I have also used wired to Creative LABS SXFI which is truly amazing .,0
I bought one of these as a gift. I thought it was great especially considering the size. Don't be fooled by it's size............,0
I bought this almost six months ago and it still works as well as when I first used it. The sound quality and volume is much better than I expected. Happy with this purchase!,0
I am a faithful Bose customer,0
I read the reviews of others. My ears made the decision.  I don't know what some people are looking for,0
We purchased this product for our grandsons 13th birthday as it was top of his wish list,0
It's great sound. Using with Denon ARV 3000x with sub. Sound quality much better them before. It's very clear sounds with Denon ARV 3000.,0

I love my Bose SoundDock. It is so easy to snap my iphone on and have instant music. Easy to attach my lap top and again,0
Brilliant product,0
Got them for Christmas,0
I received this master piece 2 days back.....I love the sound quality and the bass it gives is amazing.will update you more info about it in a week.,0
I really enjoy my DSW Pro 400 speaker. Great low frequency sound,0
Bought a couple two years ago and still on the first one. I use it all of the time mostly during workouts and they sound fantastic. These are a great buy. Only downside is that they may be a bit large for people with small canals.,0
I've always had good luck with Bose products and this one is no different. It has good not great sound but overall I'm happy with it and would recommend it.,0
I have been using the headphones for about a month now and I am very happy with the structure that does not feel like it will break at the swivels. I really enjoy the multiple connected Bluetooth feature,0
Had them for a day,0
5 years ago I used the Bose A-20 head lights,0
This is one of the best bluetooth speakers that I have ever used. It connects to my iPhone with ease and starts playing right away. The bass on this speaker is ground shaking (Literally!) When playing at full volume,0
I purchased these a month ago and vey quickly realized how well they work for class. You'll never miss instructions,0
Es muy buen wooffer,0
My son -in-law has one of these and we used it at my Fathers Funeral. I liked it and purchased a refurbished item for the sale price shown ,0
It came in the mail today and withing 5 mins i and ripped open the box to be veryy pleased with the quality,0
I bought it 2 weeks ago and the sound is perfect as it suits the music i love ,0
I bought two (blue & white) factory-renewed Soundlibk Color II six months ago. And they sound great in stereo (Left & Right) or party mode. Battery life is more than I needed for daily use. No problem at all and got them at a lower price. They look and sound like new! Great buy! Excellent!,0
Just a really well rounded speaker! I've found no obvious flaws to speak of. I sounds great,0
Bought this for my daughter and she loves it. So glad I bought this JBL unit. Best quality and price.,0
I received a black Soundlink Color recently as a gift and overall,0
I’m about to buy my third one so I can have one at my work one at home and one of my art area      good bass.. pairs up easily   super convenient with quality sound    A Purchase  I have been very happy about,0
It's comfy and pair with my Android phone real quick. The noise cancellation is excellent. However,0
I bought these headphones for specifically for working out but,0
It's all there,0
Bought new QC25 - incredibly happy with them - improvements to the case as well as the comfort of the headphones - all good imho.,0
Went to Best Buy,0
These are by far the best set I've ever used. I take them to all my (numerous) international flights,0
Got this for our daughter for Christmas. Excellent sound and very cool lights. She loves it. Could use more bass but it sounds very clear and crisp.,0
I just got them. I was a bit scared that they would look a bit too big on me,0
these are preaty frekin awesome i have ualways stuck to rocksfort folsgate  they are so bad ass but for the price and sound these polk subs are loud !!! only thing bad is that the surrounding of the rubber is coming off,0
This was my first speaker from Polk and i must say İ am impressed with the sound however İ wanted a different color so have them painted in piano black,0
Amazing bass,0
Example: bought my second Bose N/C headphones,0
These are the best headphones i have ever used the sound quality is very high also the bluetooth works very well,0
I like the headphones,0
I bought two Arena 170 speakers for my room. They're good for small and medium size rooms. The sound quality is a great quality. These are perfect for entery level speakers especially if they're going to be the first floor standing speakers you purchase.,0
Just bought this again for my office. It is amazing and sounds so good. I wish it was  rechargeable to take it outside.,0
After hearing it it was a got to have the best portable speaker i have ever owned even the wife can work it,0
I bought these about a month ago and I'm totally pleased! Over the years I've tried many different in-ear headphones and these are the best by far!,0
i have had these ear buds for a couple of months then got a new PC laptop,0
I own a pair of these.  I also use Apple Watch.  If you use any other type of heart rate monitor,0
I purchased one for my sister,0
I bought these speakers for the downstairs of my home with plans to upgrade to a larger soundtouch down the road. The only thing I am disappointed with is when used in the same room you cannot have stereo sound Left/right channels only mono.,0
Bought these headphones strictly for gym use and they are great. Lightweight and comfortable to wear.,0
I purchased this speaker for use on my boat and so far it's the perfect little speaker.  I'm going to get another one to add a little more sound.,0
Its been a week now since I had this unit and im very impressed with it features. I use it at the gym when Im swimming,0
I just purchased this sub to replace the sub that came with my Kenwood theatre in a box. Just this box has breathed new life into my old system. The richness and clarity of the bass is incredible. I was able to max out my new Onkyo 85w reciever and there was no distortion at all.,0
This little device is a marked improvement on the original go speaker. I think the edition of a passive radiator has really helped  the bass. If you want something that is ultra portable and has a nice sound look no further. Well done JBL!!!,0
Excellent bass as advertised.  Blocks out all ambient noise completely so keep that in mind for safety.  Pads can get sweaty.  Power button a bit unresponsive - you have to try several times to turn on or off.  Sound is full and complex,0
Very good sound,0
I purchased these wireless speakers about two months ago,0
Love this speakers. They make my soundbar better! You can even raise the speakers volume with the bose app.,0
I like JBL products and I'm glad to see kids headphones designed with the Safe Sound feature to prevent damage to hearing.  The design,0
I got 4 of these badboys in my isuzu amigo and recently hit 137.7db! Theres nothing like tellin these guys with 12s and 15s that my 8s are louder!,0
recently upgraded from the 7s and found the 9s to have more weight in the bass and also richer midrange. they sounded better balanced and could play louder too. there may be better speakers musically but for music and movies,0
This speaker is BIG.  It sounds GREAT,0

I love these headphones! They have really great features too! Couldn't beat the awesome deal JBL was having,0

I bought this last week to use it while travelling. I feel it's perfect for travel. Needs some improvement on sound quality for sure.,0
if your thinking of buying a sound touch then dont wait,0
These are the best earphones ever. Once you have tried them you cannot go back. Using them simply blocks the world out. Truly amazing,0
This is a great product. It's easy to carry and it's durable and the speakers are really clear and strong!,0
This was given to me as a present and its one of the best presents ever. the sound is amazing,0

I have just been brought one of these by my wife for my birthday,0
I bought this a few months ago and i am so glad i did! Amazing sounds quality compaired to many others i have bought!,0
I purchased this at target today and tried out in the car before leaving the parking lot and for such a small speaker puts out nice sound and bass. Nice product for JBL,0
Ive been using these for a couple of days now and the sound is very clear,0
We absolutely love our radio and we had an issue with an older 3 cd changer they took care of pronto and I for one cant say enough about the service they provide after the sale ,0
Needed some earbud style earphones for watching videos and listening to music and these work great. With the good sound you expect from JBL and a comforeable fit you can not go wrong with these.,0
Bought for an open air,0
I bought two and am very happy with them. Great sound and fast shipping from JBL. Can't go wrong with JBL. I've been buying from them for 40 years!,0
Would make a far superior product if it had both a earphone jack,0
Best headphones I have ever owned. The noise cancellation works great. ( Well ... my family may think they work too well. But I am happy. ) The sound experience is hard to believe. I would highly recommend these headphones and think they are well worth the price.,0
make a great stero for playing music. grandaughter listens to music on her iPhone. Now when she desires she can listen to music without earphones and the sound that comes from the JBL OnBeat aWake is great for such a small unit.,0
They give really good sound. T hey are super comfortable The Bluetooth is a nice touch. One of the best head phones Bose made:),0
It is 4am and my roommate is sick and snoring to where I could not fall asleep. I put these in and immediately can not hear him and felt the need to write this review to express how amazing they are.,0

My roomate used to work at Circuit City and sell car audio equipment. for my birthday i bought myself 2 pairs of these speakers and a head unit. When i came home my roommate flipped. clearest sounding speakers. what a bargain. i bought a polk sub 2 days later. super clear.,0
Bought them after using many other brands and was not sure about the sound quality until I took my own music on my iPod to the Bose shop,0

I would recommend this Product to anyone,0
Awesome speakers!  Use them as my rears and surrounds in my 7.1 channel system and not only do they sound great but they look awesome too being concealed!  These replaced my RM8 satellites which were good but these go seamlessly with the ceiling and the sound ls so full!,0
Sounds incredible  just moving the rear channel from the front to the back is great. Not having dudes in my attic disturbing the blown in insulation made my decision.,0
WELL I'VE GOT TO ADMIT THESE POLK AUDIO SPEAKERS ARE THE BEST I'VE EVER HAD,0
I bought two of these as gifts for my niece and my nephew. Hank figured it out right away,0
I´v only used it this weekend but im soled. My friend had one and I was impressed with the base from sutch a small thing and the clarity in witch it delivers the sound with only bluetoth. No WiFi. The puls led lights came as a surprise...acctually its a bit cosy in the dark Scandinavian Winter.,0
I love NOT getting Tangled up in wires while wearing these. The sound is Great,0
Have had my system for a 24 hours and I am amazed at its performance when I listen to CDs I have heard before I now hear sounds from the orchestra that I never heard before it's truly a wonderful music system,0
Better with every use. MUST be used properly. Well thought out..great for long flights and passive noise reduction was more than expected. Active noise reduction and mic quality is unsurpassed. Best headset out there. Do yourself a favor and purchase one...well worth it. Very satisfied.,0
these headphones just block out everything else and let you focus on the best thing,0
The Bose Computer MusicMonitor are expensive,0
"These speakers are some of the best I have ever owned. Sound clarity is superb- very clear and handle high volumes well. Bass response is great for a 6"" speaker. Overall I would give them a very high score.",0
These are to date,0
Great for traveling except there's no fast usb c charging. Who wants to carry an old slow micro usb cable around in 2018.,0

I bought a pair of Model 7's in 1978 and teamed it up with an NAD 7020---Fantastic sound. the NAD is a clean ,0

I bought this about 2 weeks ago and am really happy with it. The sound quality is absolutely amazing and has good base as well.,0
Headphones are light weight. fits perfect in the ear and  hold in place. it is well made and flexible. Sound quality is good over all. You hear very little noise from outside. I wish it came with some type of bag even cloth one would of been nice,0

Easy set up.  Excellent sound.  The noise canceling is amazingly effective.  Only negative is the price points.,0
Upgraded from the SB300 to the SB450 last week. Unbelievably better in all regards. The soundbar itself it extremely crisp and detailed. The subwoofer is more smooth and twice as powerful. Bravo JBL,0
Great sound. Works perfectly. This is the most comfortable headphone of all. I tried on every headphone Best Buy has. The Bose is costly,0
I THOUGHT I WAS GIVING UP SOME QUALITY WITH INN WALL SPEAKERS.  NOT THE CASE AT ALL.  I USED THESE ALL AROUND IN A 7.1 SYSTEM.  THEY ARE AWESOME.,0
I got this to have on my golf bag when I talk the course and this is perfect and does not add to much to the bag,0

I brought these about a month ago from Amazon Woot,0
Pros: I love the sound (5 stars). I love the mic push/hide. The headset is well made and doesn't feel like it will break. Cons: not made for big heads and the biggest issue which is Microsoft's fault the mic sound quailty (you have to speak very loud to be heard).,0
Bose best ever for another brands its launge every year super productsbut it very expensive for me i wise to buy bose product,0
I gave these headphones for my 7 yr old nephew . He was very happy with them. What I did also notice is that the quality is fantastic and have very efficient noise cancelling functions. They also have a very nice appearance.,0

Overall a smart compact package,0
I used this at the airport and at the hotel. The sound system with bass was Awesome. Love Love Love!,0
Very happy with these headphones. Sound quality is excellent. Battery life could be better. Using active noise cancelling causes battery to deplete rather quickly. Battery life can be significantly extended by disabling ANC if not needed. Fit is comfortable and pleasant.,0
All I have to say is color,0
I've had my pulse 2 for about a year now.it's the best speaker I've ever tried! The bass is awsome and it's very clear! The best of the best without a doubt. The colorful display is great and battery lasts a long time!,0

First of all,0
People actually can really hear you talking and that's the best part even if you are in a crowded place and noisy place they will be able to hear you and if you listen to music you won't be able to hear people around. Like you live in your own world of Dj,0
Great sound and bass. At first I was skeptical but once I hooked it up to my rand started streaming music I was sold .,0
Build quality is great and sound is good however if you do some research you can find equal and even better sounding speakers that are louder for less money. I think it's over priced and your paying for the name here. Over all it is a great speaker though.,0
I bought these (ES30) loud speakers for my mini Hi-Fi system. They really work and sound great with the surround speakers that came with the system,0
I love my SoundLink mini and use it at work. I decided to get the SoundLink III for Home and Park gatherings.... I was Shocked to discover that there was NO Cradle! That I have to fork over another $35.00 for it! Really?? After Market purchase for a cradle? That is just wrong :(,0
Have been waiting for Bluetooth earbuds for a while now. Sound quality is great. Could use a few more sizes of interchangeable rubber buds. Easy setup for me,0

Great sound quality,0
This is a well built subwoofer. Beats amazing though it is just an 8 inch driver.  Highly recommended.,0

best headphones iv bought from bose ever will not use any other audio products. Must buy if you are a gym rat.,0
This is a good all around center channel speaker with clean sound since it's a three-way design. It's not quite as clear as the LC2 since the LC2 is a four-way design,0
Bought this headset as an upgrade to my older qc20,0
Amazing sound range and quality from such a compact speaker. I have a much larger considerably more expensive Bluetooth speaker and this gives it a real run for the money.,0
Heard a friends Charge 3 and knew I needed to but this! beats the socks off a Bose mini speaker that I had to replace! Veryy impressed!,0
Great sound for a small portable speaker. It paired easily to my devices  (both Apple products so far but will add a laptop soon). Have not tested the full blown volume yet but fills a good size family room on medium volume. Very clear with hints of base.,0
The SOURCE button shows up on the tv and scrolls by itself,0
I am really happy that I bough this item. Small,0
Got this a few weeks ago and it sounds amazing with clear audio that makes you pump up and jam in the morning,0
Added to an amp to pair with ceiling speakers the sound is complete now with the deep base this sub adds. Thumbs up!,0
If you want a bluetooth speaker with fuller sounds and bass than your average,0
These are great headphones. I never realized how much ambient noise was in my home until I bought these. Best money I've spent in a long time!,0

Purchasing from Harman was a pleasant experience throughout.  From the technical advice I received to the immediate shipping,0
I thought I could not find a replacement for my previous computer speaker system.  I was looking especially for powerful bass output.  This system does that and has crystal clear highs.  Plus it is easy to set up and use with my MacBook.,0
I bought my bose system last year in April and I will never go back to a stereo again. As I said,0
My husband is very pleased with his gift. He was amazed when he did not have to quickly put it on the charger. It does what it says it does. Has an awesome sound and last a very long time on. Best gift every I purchased for my husband,0
i bought these headphones about 6 months ago and i cannot believe how great they are at first i was skeptical because the battery but it last longer than i expected and just blew me away with the quality of the product would recommend to any and everyone I LOVE THESE HEADPHONES!!!!!!!!!!!,0
Bought as Christmas present for 15 year old son. He was very impressed with it. It looks so different from other systems that look mass produced and the bass is awesome. Perfect for today’s music for young people. Tremendous piece of kit. Does justice to all types of music played.,0
I bought the Charge2 and have not regretted it at all. The charge lasts longer than other products. Ease of operation is a big plus. It tethers via Bluetooth quickly. The sound is excellent. Great tone and very sharp. Thank you JBL for a quality product with fast and efficient service.,0

Only the main bar is x2 times heavier than the other bars of the same series,0
I purchased this speaker about 2 months ago and have enjoyed the sound of this speaker. Before purchasing I compared this with the pill and I was sold,0
After about six months,0
they are very comfortable.  I could have gone one size smaller because I have small ear canals but other than that they work great,0
I BOUGHT THE 6 CHANGER CD PLAYER 15 YEARS AGO AND THE PLAYER IS WORKING GREAT. NO TROUBLE WITH THE PLAYER. IT IS JUST ADDITION TO MY BEDROOM,0

I like it because it is easy to play and it is really small to carry out and can play wherever I want it I think is the perfect speaker,0
The sound quality is great. Gives a total stereo effect and encompasses the whole room. Well worth the money.,0
Purchased for our granddaughter for Christmas in the red color she wanted and she just loves it,0
I'm happy I bought them a few months ago. Sometimes they can feel heavy on your head but after some time you get used to it. Quality sound.,0
I did a lot of research online and I'm very happy I picked the SoundSport Wireless earbuds. Amazing sound quality and much better value than Beats!,0
I purchased this 3 weeks ago and am very pleased with the sound quality and construction of the speaker.  Out of the box the speaker was used friendly,0
it was sent to me by a friend from  the united states..its an extremely excellent sound system never hard a sub sound so clean,0
I love these headphones. 16 hours of battery life and when the battery dies you can still listen without the noise canceling feature. So you are never without sound. Worth every penny.,0
Im bying a second revolve +.....just bought a ski boat with no sound system in it...my 2 revolve + will be my sound and music,0
"Hits smooth and clean. Has really good depth for a 10"" sub. Just want you need to boost you sound quality in your car.",0
These beautiful cans are awesome. I now have two s500 the slate and now the chromes. They sound fantastic from the highs mids and lows the way music should be heard. Keep up work JBL.,0
I just bought these today. Blown away ! The sound is signature JBL. Perfect balance of everything. Priced fair. Couldn't be more pleased.,0
I'm going on my fourth Bose wave radio. Actually two are gifts. I keep upgrading so I just love Bose .,0
This is a really good speaker,0
i ordered 3 of these few weeks ago . use one myself and gave 2 to grand kids. good deal for the price and every day use.,0
I can not get the USB a to work and there is nothing in the manual to show  how it works USB A won’t play files mp3 or way,0
I bought this excited that I found a Bose for my 4K QLED tv and I find the speaker just to be ok. I wish they gave more preferences for volume and equalized sound. I have other Bose docking stations that sound better?,0
Sure it sounds great and is durable enough. I only had one issue with it. The battery goes out after a year regardless of what you do with it.,0
I brought year ago and I set up with zone 2 and work is great and great sound I play all day sound like big speaker easy to install and I highly suggest to buy this speaker because bose is brand name. ...thanks....jaspal,0
I’ve had mine for almost a year and I love them the sound is amazing but you have to expect it with Bose but the durability is fantastic I though I lost them when I wiped out on my bike and a car ran them over but they at damage at looks but still works perfectly fine like they are brand new,0
I purchased the sleep buds about 4 weeks ago ,0
Excellent sound for the size and price. I'm thrilled that I can hook up my laptop too. My only quibble is that I would have preferred a multi-CD option.,0
I have the Polk RTi 10 Fronts and the CSi A6 center and the F/Xi A6 surrounds and I cant hardly find movies to keep up with these speakers. And music is amazing most of all people like when they see them and love them when we watch movies.great speakers.,0
Bought the Bose SoundLink Mini after viewing and listening to a number of other speakers. This is by far the best Mini speaker system I have heard. It is so easy to set up and the sound has to be heard to appreciate what others have written. Five stars.,0
I love Polk Speakers,0
"Quick install. Very easy. If you don't have ""struts"" behind where they go then just use WallMates or Toggle bolts. Problem solved.",0
"Purchased two months ago as an add-on to a new smart TV. Set up was a breeze! I love being able to use the bluetooth feature with my computer and phone as well. My favorite ""default setting "" is using the ""sports"" setting. The EQ'S sound the best for all usage",0
excellent sound,0
I purchased this  through  Verizon wireless,0
Like the title states,0
"My 42nd birthday present (to myself) and the rest of the family seemed to have ""honed in"" on it......thank you BOSE ",0
My husband got me a Flip speaker for Valentine's day.  He was really impressed with it but wanted something bigger.  I got him the Charge 3 for our anniversary and he is thrilled with it!  Great speakers for sure!,0
Sounds is good but the usb charging needs to be angled to charge correctly.  Refurbished 29.99 so I suppose so..  Overall V.good,0
I bought this 2 weeks ago had a little trouble setting up,0
really good sound quality useful if you do not like in-ear headphones like default apple ones,0
Just bought this and thought t may be to small for the living room. IT's worked out so well may have to buy a second one for the game room. I wanted something that would allow me to hear spoken word better and this did the job.,0
Perfect sound and very loud it's also very splash proof like I can put it under a tap and no damage will be done 10/10 product I rate it,0
I vought it to take on the beach. I literally started a party on the beach with it. I was great. So great that when I lost it I ran out the nextday to buy another. I just wish they had some better (girly) colors,0
I bought this for my 12 year old music loving son for Christmas. He loves it! Sounds great! He takes it everywhere. Easy to connect to his iPhone,0
although its a great cable I'm a little disappointed that it didn't last that long. a little over a year and the jack snapped.,0
Got it for Christmas. Very east to connect to my S5. Not very good instructions. Nothing better on line.,0
not a bad center channel just don't seem to be what I am look for feel like I am missing something from the center channel,0
Jbl flip is one of my favorite speakers to use. i have two Jbl speakers. the other is a jbl pulse 2. Jbl Flip charges fast and is very portable. it's the perfect size. i have no complaints about either product. they are my favorite!!,0
Just got my JBL speakers less than a month ago and they are the best.  Great sound!  Worked withe equalizer to get the best sound...love them!,0
If you're considering the Infinity center channel,0
These are great headphones and the sound quality is outstanding. I would recommend them to anyone who is looking for a pair of quality headphones.,0
I bought this device about 3 weeks ago and now I wish I would have gotten the 4. The bass sounds a lot better on the 4 vs the 3.,0
I bought one of these a year ago for my oldest son. He loved it. Since then I bought one for every member in my family. Including my other children,0
I bought this about a week ago. Wanted some headphones with some bass quality! And wow this have amazing bass. Best ones I have owened and prefer this alot better than vmoda,0
Bought my JBL subwoofer a couple of weeks ago and love it. Add a great low end bass to my home theater system. Nice to be able to adjust the bass level when I want a lot of bass that rattles the Windows or turn down the level for a subdued sound with everyday tv watching.,0
The sound output is great,0
I am overall a Bose person I have the qc 15 and these to these are very potable and small and have great quality I use it for school and it is awesome!!!!!!!!!!,0
This thing rocks and the sound quality is amazing. I love the app it's worked great for me. Will be buying a 3rd,0
I bought these for a trip to San Francisco,0
I have tried them all Zik,0
I bought this from Delhi Airport,0
This piece of equipment really does transform the sound from my television. Astoundingly good and so easy to set up. Expensive yes but worth every penny. Personally,0
I got it as a gift. Initially I thought it was going to be another gadget in the closet and when I paired it with my cellphone and started playing my music I fell in love with it. My daughter liked it so much that she kept it for herself.,0
got these a week ago. as long as you understand the purpose of these,0
I love the sound quality and the ability to connect multiple speakers together and I’ll continue to buy more to add to my collection for parties,0
I bought my jbl last year. Just bought One for my sons 38th birthday!! Him and his wife love it and can't wait until Weather warms up so they can sit Outside!!,0
Works perfect with my Samsung devices but not with my iPhone nor my iPad Bthooth cant find any device or it wont connect,0
These are great headphones with only one major flaw,0
I bought this speaker and the bigger Soundlink as well,0
I purchased this several months ago and use it daily,0
I like the concept and the speakers sound great. It is difficult to go from my IPhone and then to my Kindle Fire and maintain connectivity,0
Bought for my husband as a Christmas gift. He works construction and loves this speaker. Clip it on your belt and go.,0
Very surprised with the fit and sound of this earphones!! They will not leave your ears once there in!! Great product!,0
Good improvement especially in bass in the new Flip. Seems like it takes less time to sync up when 2 are connected. I also Like the small aesthetic changes to differentiate it from the Flip 3. Not to much needed to change there. It's just better than the competition especially at it's price.,0
I bought these about a month ago,0
I bought them a few weeks ago and they worked perfectly for me,0
The sound that comes from this little speaker is AMAZING!! Living on the Pacific Coast it is always raining and love the fact that it is also waterproof.,0
These are awesome wireless headphones!  I wish that I bought these earlier.  Exactly what you would expect from Bose.,0
Bought this system this weekend and tested it on Sunday. WOW!!! What a system. Tested it with my favourite CD and heard parts of it I had forgotten about. If you want perfect music this is the system to go for,0
Bought these a few months ago,0
I bought it from circuitcity. I had a MTx 6500 D Class amp but it went bad. So i seen the polk 500.1 amp. I got some Treo 12.4 4ohm speakers. I said could they push them? So they hook them up and i said Yeah!!!! I thought polk oly made speakers. I was wrong. Best choice i made so far.,0
Installation was a breeze. software took a bit of time,0
Its really good speaker. I have revolve+ and soundlink mini but this is my favorite bcos of the size,0
I bought this for my granddaughter. Seemed to be well made. She says it's awesome! So we are happy with it.,0
These earbuds are very light and sound good for their size.  I also own the Soundsport wireless,0
I always love Bose products. This product is very basic and I was looking for features to be above average so hence the reason for the less than excellent ratings.,0
This is our second “Charge” speaker.  The first was for our son.  We liked it so much,0
I bought it online and I am using it for the past 1 week and believe me is really really comfortable and has a great grip. It can be used for hours and you will never feel any pain in your ears. I am going with 5 stars for the product,0
I just brought it on Saturday. I am extremely satisfied with its sound and base quality.Before purchase,0
For the few times I used it,0
Ilove polks speakers all my speakers are polks but the sub I got the sub 6 mouths ago and its great before i had a kenwood 12inch. it was ok but the polk far better.,0
These are my first pair of wireless headphones and I now am a customer for life. I have had no issues at all. They stay in my ear. They keep their charge. I use them for running,0
Great speaker for its size. Not bulky. Excellent booster speaker for my phone. I am very content with this product,0
I have not been this impressed with sound quality since the flagship Ohm speakers of the 70s. The sound is rich,0
I just put some in my Camaro Z28. They really improved the mids and the highs. Their clarity is outstanding,0
I'm a former musician with live performance and studio recording experience. There are no better headphones than JBL Synchros S700. I've tried them all. I admire JBL for such high quality standards. ,0
Très satisfait. Avec ma Sony 43pouces(2003) c'est un bon combo. Et encore plus heureux du prix : 1000$ canadien plus taxes (15%)pour un récepteur Sony STR-DE598 + Polk RM6900.Futur Shop (Chicoutimi). 10 août 2005.,0
I already had one,0
I’ve had the speaker for a while now it performs outstanding it’s been to campfires on bike rides to the store and work I’ve never had an issue with it the battery last forever the waterproof feature is awesome,0
Great sub woofer next to my other Studio L speakers. The Stuido L890 goed deep,0
I bought these a few months ago now and they are still the same perfect headphones I bought from the site. Amazing sound quality and the noise cancelling is sublime and perfect for any environment your in. Totally worth the money,0
200% satisfied ,0
Out of the box and immediately into service. Paired our devices seamlessly.  Big full sound from a very portable device.  Thank you Bose for your ongoing commitment to quality products.,0
Gave these to my 16 yo son as a gift. He says the sound quality and fit are fantastic. He is very picky about earbuds and audio gear in general. Fit is snug but solid and very comfortable.  Will buy another for myself when I need workout earbuds.,0
I need white noise to sleep while my spouse loves quiet. I got these as a Fathers Day gift and got the sleep I've been dreaming of. After months of not getting a good nights sleep,0
Bought this direct from jbl a week or 2 ago and couldn't be more satisfied. The sound,0
just hooked them up... sound great!!!!great price.. fast delivery.....   great value..... free shipping,0
I bought this some days ago these headphones are really good they give a really nice isolation from noise and the earplugs fit really good and are very good for doing some jogging.,0
I bought several of these for myself,0
I have had these great speakers since they came out. I have 3 amps hooked up. A Pioneer Elite (100 watts) which has a old Sansui Amp 919 (150 watts) connected to it for the bass,0
Got the headset today,0
Originally bought the charge 2+ which had issues with its battery was replaced by the charge 3 and honestly it was the best upgrade ever! I use the speaker everywhere home work in the car since the car doesn't have an auxiliary port the sound quality is amazing and the bass is the best!,0
I love this tool to help me study and reduce anxiety from noise and overloaded social chatter. Thanks! Best purchase in years!,0
I won't buy anythng but Bose I have been spoiled my tv,0
I bought the JBL endurance jump wireless earphones about 2 weeks ago. True,0
I bought these 2 weeks ago and have been working out in the gym and running on the  treadmill.  I sweat alot and they give me no problems. I love  the sound and seem to be able to run further without any problems.,0
This is my system which is geared for music only . 400 watts per sub is nice! One will do the trick for most home theaters . Two will bring the house down! Hopefully they will last . Have fun !!!,0
I got one of these little Micro's for myself and my grandson. We both just love the sound and features.,0
Best Headphones I have ever owned. They are addictive I can't seam to get enough of them. Really easy to setup and connect. I have 3 other headsets and this one beats them hands down,0
I've had this sub for about a month and I am very impressed with the quality of the sound as well as the overall build quality. Great sub,0
I bought these speakers after spending many weeks of shopping 25 years ago and I am still happy with them.,0
the thing is this particular product is not available anymore which is really annoying ,0
This sub is nothing but greatness. The bass is clear and crisp. I have a set of Kenwood surround speakers and this matches them perfectly. You get a lot of boom for your bucks.,0
I went shopping for a good sub at a resonable price and this sub was the one! It has change my 5.1 surround system 180 degrees. It rattles the pictures off my walls and has a great low end sound with no distortion. I would recomend this sub to anyone!,0
I use this subwoofer in my bedroom,0
Strong materials,0
Best priced speaker that exceeds much higher priced systems. Exceptional performance for speaker sizes,0
My Husband just bought this for me yesterday. Ii love the sound and that i can use it with my android tablet and phone i would recommend it to anyone,0
This is the best speaker for the money it is water proof and the sound quality is awesome my whole family loves these speakers,0
It's been 5 days and all the time on my head... Voip calls,0
I purchased this after seeing it on GMA. It is exactly what I need. I use it mainly for phone calls. The Bluetooth connectivity was so easy to setup. For conference calls,0
I own medium class IEMs from Westone and while they are awesome,0
very nice speaker but needs bi-wiring to really put out all it has .  I have them wired to my b speakers on a marantz h.t 7500 and it really cleans up the sound try it you won,0
Got it for  mission trips and it’s amazing! versital,0
So happy that I bought this. Its small but has awesome quality. Easy to use and set up. I am so thrilled that I purchased this,0
Thisnis the speaker that's fun for the entire family!  The sound is great and everyone loves the colors.  Its cool to use the feature that allows you to match the speaker's color with the color of Anything around you.   Cool stuff!,0
Being a Seahawks fan and this neon green being one of my favorite colors,0
Excellent earphone when listening to the piano,0
purchased as christmas gift for my son. Incredible volume for small speaker. Clean sound,0
Love that these headphones stay in place while I run.  I love the added features of microphone,0
Better than I could have hoped for,0
Great sound quality and even better display loved the newer features like the connect and water resistant,0
I purchased 2 and love them. The app is good once you know how to use it. The one negative is the lack of descriptive instructions.  On Cyber-Monday I paid $149.99 each was the icing on the cake.,0
Used for 3 months now & they're the best for running I've ever used. Never fall out when sweaty & easily last the length of my (fairly short!) run :-),0
When we put them in good position in the ears the sound clear and strong bass... excellent. But not easy to do like that and them loose out of good position easily... sound too thin without bass... poor.,0
"Ybx7hx  <a href=""http://kyfftqymtmnw.com/"">kyfftqymtmnw</a>",0
Truly exceptional...there is an immediacy and impact--both sonic and emotional--with the 590's that is absent from all but perhaps the top 2% of most 'real world' speakers. Off-the-charts price-to-performance,0
I got this for $249 not $349 in the shop and sounds amazing! So far the only thing I find annoying is when the Bluetooth cuts out for a second but apart from that it’s good!,0
Love the headphones. Wish the over ear part was a little bigger but other than that really great product,0
Easy and very comfortable to use  The sound is great and clear The price is the cheapest among other wireless headphones,0
My weekend car is actually garaged at the moment so I'm using it in my home entertainment system. Powered by a 500 watt computer power source. It sounds great. The remote is nice. I've spent twice as much and not been as happy.,0
Fantastic product with the usual great Bose sound.  Have added this to my Wave SoundTouch IV,0
Great open and natural sound! Best portable I've heard. If you're an audiophile it compares favorably to a warm (but accurate) tube sound (vs. transistors). Great mid range. It's only limited by the quality of the signal you feed it--a great signal sounds extraordinary.,0
i bought these due to a few people on a facebook page recommended them. i am blown away from the quality sound!,0
Just installed basspro8 in my 2011 Jeep jk,0
I have never ever been disappointed in a Bose product and I am old and gray and have had and have most of the products. Quality always and the design of each product is superb. To add to this,0
I wish I could actually listen with the full volume but it's to loud for my busy environment. Sound is very clear and detailed even at low volume and I'd recommend it,0
Great product,0
i bought my in july.these are the best headphones to get.Reasons 1. there light2.great sound.3. you could wear them all day,0
Just bought my JBL Pulse 2 yesterday and I loved it! The only thing is I am trying to figure out where did they put the light modes that was available on JBL Pulse 1. I really miss that!,0
Had the speaker for 2 years. Use it regularly. Battery is still good. Have no complains other than the buttons are loosing it's shine. Other than that it's a good little speaker.,0
I was looking for a decent small speaker for work and I'm very impressed. It's a good value for such a terrific sound. I work in a maintenance shop and only have to turn it up half way. The sound is nice and clear,0
I bought this a while ago and its amazing I have know problems with it it was very easy to hook up.i got it in the mint green color and everybody was amazed when I hosted my outside parties,0
When using this product in the Bose shop,0
I bought these couple weeks ago and very happy with these items . The prices were incredibly,0
Very well designed and styled speaker unit,0
Research done I was committed to Bose,0
The pure sound at all sound levels and frequencies was incredible. I owned 4 of these for five years and had tobsellnthem.  Imintendbto hut four more of the RTaa1's as soon as possible.,0
The detail in these Atruim 45's is excellent,0
I just bought this today. I am moving today and must say i did more dance than pack. The sound is unbelievable. So happy with this unit. Thank you Bose for coming out with this portable speaker.,0
very impressed by the sound reproduction of this unit. It's accurate and versatile. You can use it as a simple bluetooth speaker for you ipod or as a speaker to make your favorite TV shows boom. The AUX input is an excellent feature. GREAT speaker!,0
I got this for Christmas and WOW what a gift - so amazing for sound and the life of the battery. Would totally recommend this to any music lover =D,0
I've had this remote for about a year and use it daily. I don't usually take it out of the stand. It's very well built and the range is incredible. You don't have to point it at the radio.,0
I have been using Yurbuds earphones for many years and they have been the best at staying in my ears during my running and workouts at the gym!  The sound has also been excellent.  My most recent purchase of Inspire 100s continue to impress me with both the sound and avbility tostay in my ears.,0
"I bought these for my partner and his words ""Best present ever""  First time in his life he could hear so well with excellent clarity and noise reduction.",0
I went to best buy planning to purchase a soundlink mini. But when I played it next to the color,0
First time I'm using jbl for home theather and wow amazing sound I'm been using  jbl for car audio for long time so I give it a try this thing puts smile on my face,0
I really like these headphones great quality and everything! But i just wish bose would have put some more bass other than that great headphones!,0
I bought these to play basketball and they sound AMAZING! I strongly recommend getting these earbuds,0
I bought the Bose Soundlink Mini II and it's connected to my open reel. I am absolutely amazed with the sound quality. It has a full rich sound and a delight to listen to. The built quality and friendly operation is second to none. I would recommend this to anyone.,0
I've had the speaker a month and super love the quality and how easy it is to use.  And I found that in using the phone charging feature way more than I expected because it's so handy.,0
Wow! Took it out of the box,0
I purchased a Charge 3 on April 13.  We charged it and used it for the entire 5 hour party and it's been sitting on my desk since then with almost daily use and the battery is still good.  Sounds good and was able to fill a full room.,0
These headphones look a bit bulky,0
I purchased expecting a lot and was blow away by the sound. I have a  100 watt Fosgate and these speakers eat it up! They are crystal clear and have great frequency response. The bass is perfect and is almost good enough to eliminate a sub.,0
I just got these today and my first impression is very good. The sound is great and they stay in place while working out or while running. Only thing I'd say is a minus is that these don't have magnetic lock on the ear buds,0
I always thought Bose were way outside my price bracket. This Soundlink is so affordable and gives great sound. I find I'm not using my big Denon system and just listening to Spotify via my iPad on the Soundlink instead. So much easier.,0
Purchased these headphones directly from Bose. The price of these headphones has dropped down significantly and although QC35 offers more features,0
Very happy with this,0
The JBL Flip 4 is my first bluetooth speaker.  I am simply amazed at the sound quality - including the deep rich bass.  Syncing with my phone was quick,0
These speakers are no joke. If you dont have much room to have subs...these are what you need...I have a Chevy S-10 reg. cab..and they absolutley POUND! Maybe if i get a bigger box for these bad boys they will hit harder,0
If I have one complaint with these,0
MY BROTHER WORKS FOR CIRCUIT CITY AND SUGGESTED THESE SPEAKERS TO ME. I WAS RELUCTANT BECAUSE I LIKED THE SOULD OF THE INFINITY SPEAKER,0
I've been watching like a hawk for these to come out in spring as I wanted it for my long haul trips. Unfortunately,0
Can't believe how awesome these pair of headphones are,0
I usually am very careful while selecting lifestyle brands. Bose products suffer often from bloated bass and rolled off treble. But this one is really good. Best wireless in its class. Far better than momentum in ear wireless and beats x.,0
I have owned for about 5 years now and they are Great on Music  and Great on movies .  you want speakers you can count on for Quality  Buy these.  Respectfully MKW,0
i love my new polk speakers,0
Tried a few  including the boise mini 2  this seems to have the best sound- question? is there a way go to forward or back to last or  next song etc,0
I bought these for my weekly flying commute,0
I love the Soundtouch music system but the one thing I miss is a connection to my iPod that would allow me to control it from the system and use the sleep mode to shut it off so I can listen as a fall to sleep at night.,0
I was,0
This speaker packs a punch. I can’t say enough great things about. It’s  easy to connect and it plays crystal clear. We love using it inside and outside. My husband and I both have our phones connected and can switch quickly between the two. It’s a must have speaker!,0
My husband did the research but he chose well. We play our AppleMusic streaming app via bluetooth & works it perfectly,0
I like it BUT  i got splashed by some water near my shower and every now and then you can here a crackling noise. So be careful even tho they say it water proff,0
My little girl loves these headphones very bright and attractive and the fact they come with stickers and she could decorate them herself made it even more of a bonus! The sound quality is spot on and the fact they can be sized adjusted means they will last longer! Overall fab item,0
I bought this less than a month ago and the left bud died. Thankfully,0
They sound amazing and the calls on them are clear.  These were really the best headphones I have ever had.,0
i've got 2 dvc 10's in an sealed enclosure in my 96 trans am and they hit hard and sound awesome...i've got an hifonics zues amp pushing them and they never flinch under high power....great work polk...definately sound and perform better than fosgate,0
I bought this about a month ago,0
Is a very clear sound and perfect device to hear all instruments and clear voices also Bose give facilities to pay ,0
The base in this speaker impresses me every time I use it ! It is very loud however it could be louder. My biggest problem with it,0
I bought a SoundLink a while ago and I must say I am very impressed. It has very good sound quality with very good bass,0
This by far is one of the best speakers out by far. A little on the expensive side... but you will not be disappointed. Definitely an instant party where ever you go...,0
Got this for the wife. On mothers days gift. She love it so much it's alway on. The sound is amazing!! And the bass is deep. Will buy again.,0
I received this headphone as a gift. Works great with my phone. I have only used at home so far. It is comfortable to lie down with it.,0
This is an amazing speaker,0
I got this package this summer and it is by far one of the best systems I ever heard. I got a kicker 300.1 monoblock amp hooked up in a 1994 ford aspire hatchback and it bangs so loud. I am about to purchase another pair and put all four in the hatchback.,0
I bought this a two weeks ago and very happy that I decided to get this instead of the beats studio,0
This is the second pair of JBL earbuds that I have bought. They fit well in your ears and the sound quality is excellent!,0
just purchased the cs2 center channel speacker and it brought my system to life as i have never heard before. thank you polk.,0
Purchased this product for outdoors and just to mess around. I have to say I love it! It’s super small and compact. It is nice to have around if you need a boost in audio quality from your phone. All in all,0
"Just bought two 12"" DXi subwoofers. Used them to replace blown Yamaha subwoofers in two 3-way home speakers (running them at 8omh). The sound is very impressive. The Polks handle high volume and maximum base with incredible ease. Glad I didn't get the Pioneers or Kenwoods. Good job",0
I am the proud owner of a Lifestyle surround sound system,0
I picked this up on 10/18/2015. Must say just blown away. JBL was a brand of quality when I was in the Army in Germany. I picked this up on what I knew back then,0
I’ve been using my set for a month.  Got them for Christmas.  Best sound and feel.  never needs readjusting during any workout,0
I went out to purchase a portable Speaker and I got just that and more. I love that JBL can package such a big punch in a quite small package. I would definitely refer to all my Friends,0
I was skeptical when I bought these earbuds,0
best in this class. if u want just gud clarity of sound,0
I won the flip-2 and use it every day at work,0
they could deliver them with usb c because many already use usb c cables for their mobilephones and some people wait until they buy new devices. and they should support wifi...,0
I bought this sup a few weeks ago! Man if you what a great sound for bass ! This sub is awesome! I know that technology has changed,0
I Bought the Xtreme.   I might want to try the Flip 3 too!  Can I pair both at the same time even though they are different models?,0
Being my first Universal remote it was a challenge at first but with the help of some internet searches for help I got the hang of it and now I'm buying another one for the upstairs TV and second Bose Solo sound system we bought.,0
I bought these to pair with a set of ES20s. My only note is that they are a bit quieter than the ES20s,0
4 stars - no amp,0
I don't give the 5 stars because it's not a 360* speaker and sometimes the bass is that strong that you can hear some weird noises with the vibrations. But in general the quality is great and the fact that it's waterproof makes it good for every adventure.,0
It add rich sound and clarity that you'll be blown away! Perfect for any sounds you wish but for me watching a movie is a top notch!,0
JBL has always made great speaker systems....and this sound bar is just more proof that they do! We just bought one for our daughter ...she loved this se sound of ours. Don't have to go to the theatre...we have it in the bedroom!! ALSO,0
Astonishing Performance !!!  This sound bar has replaced my existing Home theater system.  This product works excellent for any kindly of Music.  The only negative point is lack of display option.,0
These are Great Headphones.They block out sound really well. They don't take long to pair with your phone.The Battery life is fantastic. My Son uses them for everything,0
Really good speaker for the money,0
I am thankful that there is a supple of old headphones. However,0
I was looking for kid safe headphones that sounded good and fit good. I have 2 other JBL bluetooth speakers and as predicted these would Sound GREAT too! My 7 year old grand daughter Loves them.,0
I bought my system the day before Memorial Day and set it up that night with ease. I enjoyed my music while cooking on the holiday. I am thinking about getting another one so I can really annoy my neighbors. Lol.,0
I walk a lot on noisy streets and these earbuds really cancel the noise,0
Finally an earphone design to fit your ear. It doesn't fall or hurt.  The phone works fine. The remote is useful.  I am just waiting for a wireless version that looks like this one.,0
Very good sound. Comfortable for long hours... great battery,0
Polk has done it again with an affordable,0
wow,0
This is the most comfortable headphone i've used. I use it a lot playing playstation 4 and with my iPhone 7.,0
Purchased for Christmas as a joint present to replace our ageing Pioneer unit.The sound is very good but a bit heavy on base . However exceptional quality and worth every penny.,0
I was given tthese a little over two years ago and I am absolutely in love with them. The sound totally fills the room,0
I've been using the Flip 3 for a month now,0
I bought this as i needed a new speaker as my beats pill stopped working,0
Really great sound for all modes. Have listen to DVD,0
Bad first. I didn't get them sooner.  All good for me. All day comfort. Earbuds stay in during activities.Distortion free. No super bass but enough bass. Great for phone use. Nice gift. Quality chords and light weight neck band keep them safe and secure when not in use.,0
excellent clear sound with powerful bass. I love that the volume range. The setup is not the easiest but the calibration its easy and really improves the acoustics for your area. the app its very nice but with a little delay.,0
Sound quality is great,0
i just installed momo 6750 db in my opel astra and the sound perfect there running on a dls amp (4x50 rms + 1 x 150 rms)  the amp is just perfect for the job,0
I'm very happy with the devise. I wish I had some control over the equalizer but overall it sounds great.,0
My husband bought this speaker as a gift for our anniversary and we have both thoroughly enjoyed it. The sound is great,0
I've had this for around half a year and everything is still good,0
Bought my first Mini Soundlink 7 years ago and just bought a second one to complement the first. Never fails to amaze me,0
seems just like a new pair of soundlinks. if this doesn't appeal to you,0
We bought 3 in the last month 2 were gifts and everyone is very happy with the clarity and ease to bring along anywhere.,0
The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because it does not connect with my Flip 3.  I was really disappointed by that.  The sound is so great on this speaker!  I bought one for myself and came back and bought 2 more for Christmas gifts.,0
Bi-wired performance is superb-- very clear,0
Bought this headset and so far it has been awesome. Use at home with my cellphone as a hands free headset and at the gym to listen music while working out.,0
I bought this for my 17 year old and he loves it. He uses it as a computer speaker and then unplugs and brings it with him wherever he goes!,0
I love my new job boombox,0
Bought it two years ago and didn't have any major problems. At the beginning,0
When I was at a Bose store,0
I purchased a Revolve + expecting it to be pretty good,0
Typical of Bose,0
Play a movie like war of the worlds.  Turn the volume up to 12,0
I wanted the best possible sound in my Google Assistant,0
Very durable. Great sound quality. I did find that one of the buds hurt my ear after long wear but that may just be because I have small ears.,0
I plugged the mic into a USB port,0
I don't hear as well as I age but this was without a doubt,0
Got this for my MS-Bass Pro SQ and it is so easy to use. I listen to all kinds of music,0
I received these headphones as a gift and haven't stopped listening since. They are perfect when on the go. Allow you to be enjoy music and take calls all in the click of a button!,0
It was awesome in an open ground with around 50 audience. Also the product is specifically designed for vocals than for playing the prerecorded high bass music. so do not buy this if you will use only for listening audios/songs. if you are a speaker,0
Bought this 4 years ago and still sounds like its new.keep in mind I like my music loud so its always on high volume. its little costly but its worth every penny.,0
I absolutely love JBL. The sound is so clear and crisp I could listen to it all day long. 100% recommended!,0
Fantastic sound,0
For this price it is a very fine quality headset. I bought it as an Xbox party earplug but the quality was so fine I use it as my main headset now.,0
These headphones are great! The bluetooth works good and i can answer calls and listen to music without any wires getting in the way! They aint the loudest but the bass sounds decent i would reccomend them,0
I bought these yesterday from Target and I have to say 10/10 great headphones charging case is awesome. Battery life is exceeding expectations,0
Excellent sounding speakers for their price.  I got them for my 2-channel system with no Sub.  The bass was a little lacking for what I was looking for.  Traded them in for the RTi6's.  Much happier now.  Polk does make a very good speaker.,0
I bought this for my husband for his birthday and he absolutely loves it! He and his new JBL Flip are in his man cave just partying. Plus he took it with him on his business trip. I'm sure the folks next to him in the hotel are not too happy! Thank you!,0
Own two pair just in case  best ever over all i kinds of music not just the bass that seems to be a problem it's not the sound is crisp and clear and yes I've tried them all and returned . Praying for the day they make Truly wireless I will buy them,0
Very impressive audio component,0
I bought this a couple weeks ago and absolutely fell in love! This product was everything I was looking for. Most definitely will be recommending to friends,0
I got these headphones almost 2 years ago and I absolutely love them. I can wear them for hours without my ears hurting and the sound quality is great for anything. Definitely worth the extra money and better than other brands of the same price range.,0
Great deal. Pick up open box RTi28 for rears. These speaker were under $700 and kill sets my friends have they spent over $1800. Very happy. Compared with much more expensive systems and this was better.,0
Brought theses a few months ago as my iPhone ear buds could handle my training and music love! Crystal clear sound and let's just enough background noise in so you know whats going on around you but didn't make it destructing,0
I Bought This Speaker 5 Days Ago & So Far,0
It took some time to get them to fit just right but once the fit was correct the sound was good especially for the price. The volume is lower on them as compared to previous sets I've had.,0
I bought this system 3 weeks ago and is one of the most elite systems I had. The sound quality,0
Just bought another pair just because I couldn't find any pair that would come even close to these... However the reason I had to buy a second pair is because when using my first pair I started to hear static in both ears when the active noise canceling was on :(,0
I bought these on sale to replace 12 yr. old Infinity Beta 20's. They are used for 2 channel stereo in my bedroom. The weight is pretty heavy,0
Just got a pair for stereo music.   In the first impression,0
Polk has a great reputation for audio products. Installation was a snap on my 2000 Isuzu Rodeo. Would recommend to anyone.  You would figure that the tweeters would stay in the cups differently and more secure but they don't.,0
Seriously,0
I bought one,0
i install the c500.1 mono block amp to the sub and it sounds great but i know it can take more power.,0
I bought it just yesterday...its pretty amazing sound... the bass.... its so nice that it caught my attention when i visited one of their store in SM North... so now I have the blue color...,0
This produces the softest chimes and solid bass yet remain comfortable to listen  (i.e. not deafening).,0
I could not believe how well music sounds on these.  I bought them to help me hear phone conversations better as I am hearing defective but music incredible through them.,0
Amazing Speaker!  Very loud and it has fantastic BASS! AND IT'S WATERPROOF!  ( IM IN HEAVEN)!   GREAT PRODUCT!  THANK YOU!,0
It works very well with Spotify and their battery life is long enough for all but the longest of flights.,0
I used these recently while hiking in Death Valley and they worked perfectly.  Held in place the entire hike and sounded great.  Surprisingly good bass!,0
I just watched the movie Hacksaw Ridge.  It felt like you were on the battlefield with the soldiers.  The sound fully envelopes you.   I would like to see the connectors at the back of the unit brightly coloured to make them easier to see when connecting the cables.,0
I just bout a pair of the eon one. I still have my JBL EONS G2 and JBL JRX 118 Powered Subs which have been great for years. The EON ONE'S are a total upgrade making gigs easier. Well worth the buy. I finally replaced my old system.,0
I planned in buying sound system in the future but after hearing this sound bar in the store I bought,0
I love the quality sound. The soundlink color was easy to set up and works great. Well worth the money.Thank you BOSE,0
I bought this item for my sons birthday,0
I can't expect more from JBL. This headphone is truly the landmark for JBL. The sound is very powerful. I can feel the deep lows similar to a home surround speaker. The build quality is great . I like the leather touch on the band. It is one of the best big size headphone out there.,0
I just bought this speaker this week,0
i purchased these at the end of august they are superb speakers with quality sound for a bookshelf speaker i highly recommend these speakers,0
Great sound and very comfortable without the hassle of a cord. Easy to connect to Bluetooth,0
Our Bose cd and am/fm player would pickup lots of stain on FM so we bought and have begun using this antenna and have not (as yet) experienced any static.,0
I bought the headphones last year  So I've tested them well enough  And bose has done it again,0
I installed these to complete my Polk Audio 5.1 setup and the surround soundstage has opened up to the point of amazing.,0
I bought these are year ago and no matter what you listen to it reproduces the sounds the way it was mentioned to be heard.i love these headphones because it's like a live soundtrack on stage.,0
I used several brands and the last one I used was a Bose Soundlink I borrowed from a friend. I didn't want to pay 200.00 for a headphones,0
I am sooooo happy with my purchase! I don't need anything else! Every time someone comes to my place and here's my music playing through my speaker,0
I took advantage of the Black Friday price and got a very good deal on these wireless Bluetooth earbuds. I’m impressed with the bass tones and highs these earbuds can handle!,0
Finally tired of buying cheap but effective in-ear headphones that work fine for a couple of months I doddled into John Lewis and bought a pair of these,0
Got these a couple of weeks ago and use them all of the time.  Great for working out and way more stable than my wife's airpods.  Sound quality is very impressive for bluetooth.  I highly recommend them.,0
Just bought them. I had the SIE2i and the cord was too short and it didn't fit in my iPhone with my case. These are amazing! Sweat resistant-water proof,0
Awesome sounding speaker for its size! and the battery time is excellent! The fact that you can charge your phone as well is super!,0
The headphones meet all my expectations and I love them. They are a little pricy,0
"I just mounted these to YAMAHA V-MAX 1200 a.k.a  ""THE Harley Davidson Beater"" oh yeah",0
I JUST GOT THESE CONNECTED VERY EASY TO MY SAMSUNG PHONE,0
I bought this one day ago and I am first time user of bose product. I am happy with the product . I have seen reviews that lag in voice is there while some playing videos but I didn't face that my BBkey one .,0
I owned Bose Sound Sports last week,0
These headphones are amazing. Best headphones I have ever experienced. They give off amazing sound. The headphones keep good charge. I found pairing them up to my television,0
I bought this clip to have around the house. And it really gets the job done. I was hesitant to purchase after reading the reviews about battery life and sound,0
Best brand  Only brand I’ll ever buy I have a Bose Home Speaker 500 black and have my bass on 70 and treble 0 but more sound and bass comes out on the right side the left side is playing but does not sound the same as the right side that is more powerful,0
I love this sound link and it is easy to connect devices to them. This is where my problem lies. Everyone and anyone can connect to my speaker which is really annoying. I wish there was an optional way to passcode connect it.,0
I bought two wave music system one solo TV and another bose wave radio with Bluetooth excellent product. When I told them this is my 3rd wave radio why not throwing a free antenna? Guess what? Yes they did thanks a lot.,0
Awesome piece of kit. Exceptionally easy to set up and use. Easy to charge. Bluetooth aspect works like a charm and maximum volume is exceptional for the size of the speaker.,0
I haven't had them long enough but so far they are a good buy for the price... to clarify I bought them for $29.99 with free 2 day shipping during Cyber Monday so don't go spending 100s of $$ on them just yet...,0
The ATH-M50 has replaced my long standing go to pair of cans. No comparison. Not even close. Comfortable over time. Great for tracking but also a very viable mix tool. Very accurate. Brought back the fun of just listening through headphones for pleasure.,0
Just purchased from Fry's Electronics and installed it in my large family room. This was so easy to set up,0
I bought this a two weeks ago. Sound is awesome. TX NR545 is the best receiver to be used with this system.,0
I bought this a few year ago and I thought the sound quality,0
Got this speaker for my office based on reviews. This speaker is fantastic! Crystal clear sound and great bass. Packs a serious punch,0
Great Speaker. I replaced my outdoor rock speakers with the Polk DB651 speakers,0
Love the sound for such a small speaker. The light show is fun,0
Bought these for my son's birthday and tried them out myself. Sounds really good and I like the way they fold up and come with a case. Not sure how durable they are yet but so far no complaints.,0
I am super impressed with the product. My TV speakers had a tinny sound with very little bass. What a difference! When I hooked up the sound bar it was like night and day. I've had several Bose products and have never been disappointed. Worth every penny,0
I got this a week ago and it is so good my hifi is now defunct it brings a whole new dimension to music,0
Sound is great,0
I've Had These Phones For Almost A Year And Are Still Very Satisfied With Them A Excellent Pair Of Headphones Activate The Noise Cancelling Feature And All You Hear Is The Music.,0
I think it is just as good sound wise as the higher priced options in the smallest sizes.  I bought several more for gifts - everyone has loved them!,0
I purchased these in October 2014 for my long flight. They worked perfectly. No one heard me and I couldn't hear them lol. Go Bose,0
I purchased these headphones for my son in college. He finds that the noise cancelling feature allows him to study undisturbed by the noise associated with dorm life. In addition,0
I have purchased this Cinemate (SoundTouch) 520 system in Feb 2015 and since then my living room has turned to a mini home theatre. great sound quality and amazing bass effect.,0
This is an amazing BT speaker!  Has so much versatility.  Only wish that I went with the higher version.,0
I like the R50s BUT they cant do anything the R30s cant do plus Consumer Reports have rated the R30s an excellent buy and the R50s just a good buy so you decide.,0
I got these headphones and I love them. Despite they are bluetooth the sound is great and the battery last for ever!,0
My boss bought the one that changes color ,0
Amazing sound quality and yes its worth every penny. Did not believe such a small easy to fit device would deliver such great clear base and sound all round. Excellent work from Bose again.,0
I bought this a month ago and in love with it since then,0
Worth every cent. Plays loud and clear. Long Battery life. Has literally been taken everywhere I go small enough to pack away and carry in hand. Best blue tooth speaker. I would buy more range of JBL speakers in fact. Very easy to use,0
These speakers are great and worth every penny. I've been a huge fan of infinity and bose for a long time but these are unmatched,0
The bass is good and they have a lot of clarity.  The highs aren't piercing and the mids aren't muddy. The buds can be a little uncomfortable in the ears.,0
I own the RTi6 and RTi4's. Best speakers I've ever owned. Everything you read 'positive' about these little wonders is true. Great product at an unbeatable price. PolkAudio is the best.,0
Perfect for programmers. Last all day,0
Great quality product! Quick and easy shipping.. needed it for party in two days and showed up right on time. Perfect for the back yard BBQ,0
Excellent sound & voice clarity.I have polk monitor 40 front speakers,0
I bought this about 3 weeks ago my daughter and I love it!. She absolutely loves the colours that resonate with the music. The sound of the speaker is bassy and not so tinny,0
This arrived today. So glad we bought it. Radio picks up stations that my previous expensive Sony system couldn't. Just like another review,0
I just bought my first flip 4 yesterday,0
Bose thought of everything with this product. The sound is amazing,0
They are very good headphone. With them on you don't hear a thing but you music. Like them a lot and are cheap for the value they have. Very happy with them.,0
I have two gnx124 in a sealed box,0
Just got the OMNI S2 and EXTREMELY pleased with it! Set up is a piece of cake and the sound is just AMAZING! I will surely add a few units to the house as this makes a great ALL OVER the House music system! Way to go POLK!!!!!!,0
Excellent surround in-ceiling speakers.  I bought these for my 11X18X8ft home theater,0
I have 3 es250p these things are amazing I have also 4 jbl es80 wow they make a perfect combo together this subwwofer is nothing but quality,0
Bought one of these for all the family and office mates.  Extremely easy to use and makes an excellent speaker phone.,0
I a sound technician for more than 20 years the sound is owesome and the app works very good I can control the equalization and the. Features on the head ser the only probleM is the battery only during 6 hours,0
Everything fine for me,0
Great sound quality for a small little speaker. Portable,0
This speaker sound very good and at a price of speakers costing two or three times as much.The mids and highs are very clean .It has great voice dialouge.It matches great with a set of monitot's 70.The cherry finish look good and not cheap.,0
Perfect for getting a speaker in a tight spot....blends in perfectly to a ceiling because of the size. Polk quality audio too...cant ask for more!,0
The sound is really good. Lightweight and good quality. The case is classy. Battery life is longggg. Just been close to a month but loving it totally.,0
This incredible music machine allows you to hear every note and it makes you feel like the artist is right there. I love this wave so much,0
these are perfect for when i go to the gym and do a hardcore workout,0
Bought this soundlink years ago. Still works perfectly and sound quality is great. Highly recommend this speaker.,0
Sound is great with decent bass. The wires usually tear and I have to replace them too often. My last pair is about 8 months in and wires are exposed in several areas. Not sure they do make it for year.,0
I have had these for nearly a year and the sound and durability have been great. They have also just survived a wash with my laundry with no problems at all!!!,0
I purchased it last month,0
Bought these refurbished,0
I have bought these multiple times.  Work great and last.  The best fitting in ear headphones I have ever owned. Apple headphones just don't stay in my ears,0
Fancy! Good product with reasonable price. Only downside is hard to replace the connection cable on satellite speaker,0
I think that this is a great organization! I think this is a great way to get inspired and join an amazing organization.,0
I bought this a month ago not so thrilled with it although I love the design,0
The JBL Charge 2+ provides classic JBL sound. You can clearly hear the lowest notes from an electric 5 string bass. You won't believe such huge sound can emanate from the small enclosure.,0
"I thought I was getting the 5 `1/4"" compont ones but these will do. Has great highs at any volume",0
These are by far the best headphones I've ever owned!! The sound and clarity is amazing. I concerned they wouldn't cancel out sound but I can't hear anything but my music. These are totally worth the price!!,0
Bought this for my 8yr old. Adjustable so fits great. Sound is nice. Like that the cord is attached so it can’t be lost:),0
I got a pair a week ago and like them so far. The sound quality is decent and the Bluetooth range is awesome. I was surprised by the distance the Bluetooth range is. One downside is for people with small ears the buds fall out pretty easily.,0
My kids got me a pair of these for CHristmas a couple years ago,0
I bought several of these as gifts for Christmas and liked it so much that I kept one for myself. It's small but mighty and has amazing sound that you expect from JBL. Excellent product at a good price.,0
If we talk about sound,0
Just recieved mine today. It was easy to set up and sounds great. Pairing was very easy. I bought the cover and it's all very high quality. Very Happy !,0
Purchased this lil Go for a present,0
Does all the things my old large system used to do in a fraction of the space.Very handy,0
Speaker sounds really good didn't think it could sound that awesome up against the wall is it a little Bass or hum you can say. Sounds really nice though.,0
Hey just received this in the mail today. Been charging it for a couple hours now n when I checked on it no light was on while plugged in so I unplugged it n plugged back in the I see the red light again. How do I know when it's fully charged,0
Just put in these speakers and they sound great compared to my alpine speakers i had in there. These speakers are a great buy,0
I bought this 10 days ago,0
These are all the speaker you will ever need for most systems. They sound great and crystal clear. Unless you have a big room where you may need the larger 890s,0
This is the third receiver that I have gotten from Harman Kardon and just like the others,0
I bought these specifically because they come in XS and have never found any that fit and stay put during a brisk walk or jog. I am happy with them.,0
I have used the PRO35 for five years now. I've played with it in both large and small venue with great results. I have the hard wired and the cordless. Both sound great. Sound is a little thin on the palm keys on my Soprano. I highly recommend this mic.,0
the bose 535 home theater system is the best of the best home theater i ever had. Sounds Perfect,0
These things sound GREAT! I am a retailer for Polk Audio. The A9's sound so much better than the RTI12 towers. The low frequency response is incredible. Great all around tone.,0
Got this to link up with other Bose products and it's brills! Sound is awesome and does everything as in it's description. A great addition to the kitchen that I'm sure will have its place for a long time to come. Bluetooth,0
I bought them a while ago now for when I'm at work I'm so addicted to them they really are furfilling to my highest exspectations,0
- Good sound quality when compared to In-Ear Plug  - Stays very light on the ear,0
I snatched this item from a deal newsletter for around $20. I take this thing everywhere I go and can get the party started on a moments notice LOL. It's perfect for use at work or for setting the vibe when having a few friends over.,0
I received these as a gift. The sound is high in quality. Fit seems perfect. They have yet to fall out of my ear during a run. They seem to hold a charge well. I like them.,0
I bought this device so I could blast Rick Astley in the shower while my roomates try to sleep.  Works like a charm,0
Very nice sound! I was using them as fronts in a surround system,0
I compared these to 2 different sets of high end studio headphones and am thoroughly impressed. Studio perfection without wires! Comfort is outstanding and ear fatigue non existent after 2+ hours.  Quincy's prompts are like having him producing my project LOL!!,0
I purchased a few of these JBL Gos for christmas presents,0
Worth every penny - no joke. The way they small sound bar fills up the whole room ,0
Bought the Soundsport Free last year. One of the best earphones I’ve bought. Always been using Bose products and they haven’t disappointed me yet. Fits perfectly and not afraid to do heavy cardio cause it doesn’t fall out. Really Recommend.,0
These are pretty great headphones,0
Unprecedented sound and quality as you can expect from Bose. These are a must have for sound,0
I've only owned the headphones for an about a week,0
19 YEARS OF LOUDNESS PUT TO THE TEST. THE BEST CHOICE I EVER MADE ON SPEAKERS. I AM GOING TO GET ANOTHER SET. 19 YEARS OF THRASHING. WAIT THEY STILL WORK I AM JUST PUTTING THEM IN THE BASEMENT SO I GOT TUNES DOWN THERE. STILL CRISTAL CLEAR SOUND,0
My wife snores and wears a CPAP at night. It doesn’t drown out her snoring but definitely drowns out the noise from the CPAP machine. Has made sleeping with her tolerable again.,0
I have used these buds for two nights and so far I love them.  I do not hear a thing at night.  I play a soothing noise for about an hour but leave the buds in all night.  I wish that the noise loops were longer.  The tranquility noise is a very short loop which I noticed right away,0
Wow,0
I purchased several of these as gifts and everyone is overjoyed with the quality of the sound. Great product! My only problem is the requirement for batteries for certain features.,0
Great speaker and great sound. IF you are interested in buying a Bluetooth speaker this is the best speaker to buy.,0
Had these girls for 2 years. Polk Audio really stands for its name in these speakers! No problems with these speakers. I have them hooked up to a Harmon Kardon amp and sound better and better the loader they go. Clarity and deep tight bass. Way to go Polk!,0
i had two twelve inch rockford fosgate but these hit ten times harder and sound ten times better i strickly recomend this sub to anybody looking for a good deal and watts and watts of good sound.,0
I bought Sound bar 700 a week ago the sound quality is dope as expected but having problem with the Bluetooth it cuts off most times while playing not nice at all and I still enjoy the SoundTouch app very well with no issues. Any advise please?,0
Awesome amp for the buck!  Crisp,0
This is cool - to be able to make your own color combinations. The nice headphones in your own colors.I love it,0
I just put these in my 98 grand cheroke today. for now i am only driving them off of my head unit,0
I bought it as part of a GMA deals and steals! It was definitely worth it for the capability and usability. Was able to use it christmas day to keep the musing going and lower or raise the volume from my tablet without going over to the actual device,0
Been using the JBL GT-BassPro for the last 2 years and am very satisfied with its performance and durability. I like my music cranked and this subwoofer gives me what I want with no complaints. From Classical to AC/DC it fills the bill in my 300C.,0
The best thing about this is the look of it. You need to darken the room a bit but it really delivers on looks. The sound is also more than adequate for the size of the unit. Always connects with bluetooth easily.,0
I wish they made a bigger version of the pulse,0
I bought my jbl charge 2 last summer and have used it everywhere from work to fishing outdoor parties once even got rained on before I remembered it was outside.... the Bluetooth distance is amazing compared to other Bluetooth devices I own,0
This sub is awesome! This speaker seemed a little high priced until I heard it. Its worth every penny. Get one and enjoy.,0
Have had 2 pairs of Bose noise cancelling phones.... love them for sound. Problem is the cushion earpiece deteriorates quickly and now I have both out of use. Trying to get spare cushion replacements is a headache and a half.,0
a month ago and I'm very happy with it. It charged as well and holds a good charge. Sound is very excellent both in the upper and lower ranges. Middle-range tones are not muddy at all. Very excellent product.,0
I used these both for home listening and when using air travel. They do Avery nice job of blocking out “plane drone” while in flight. Great battery life and the Bluetooth is great. Very glad I bought these.,0
good quality headphones use them frequently for runs and gym workouts. Have held up well until about a year when the left ear went out. Luckily for the bose warranty Im able to get a new pair.,0
This is a Great product,0
Wish I could buy more.   Good fit. Great sound. Incredibly functional and hardy.  Wish I could buy more.,0
I have a lot Bose products... I keep going back because the sound quality is truly amazing and this product is no different. Just plug and play. Doesn't take up a lot of space and the sound just fills the whole upstairs no matter what the volume is on.... Clear and crisp!,0
Brought this as a temporary replacement as my van sterio broke. I think ill just keep using this it’s better than the one in my van. It’s great so powerful and clear with great base,0
Right out the box I thought this is the worst Bose product I have ever purchased. But after checking the Bose website and saw there was a software update for the headphones,0
Bought it for a Christmas gift and tested them out to make sure there where no issues. I like them so much that I will purchase me a pair after the holidays are through.,0
The recent firmware update made the voice lag issue worse. Hopefully there is a new update asap to correct this issue.,0
This product is small,0
I did buy these a month ago and I'm impressed beyond words.I have had JBL products before and they just keep surprising me.I hope they continue being the best sound products.,0
I'm a great fan of Polk's RTis,0
overall,0
I love how small and mighty this speaker is.  It's better than I expected.  And reasonably priced.  Will buy from again.,0
Sounds incredibly powerful to fit in the palm of your hand,0
Overall,0
Bought this for my wife and she loves it. I'm very happy with the design and how it sounds. Great little speakers.,0
I bought these 3 months ago. This is my 6th BOSE product. Headphones are very light and easy to use. Bluetooth range is excellent clarity is clear and crisp. Only negative I have is compared to the QC the base and volume lacks a bit. Could do with a small bit more kick 10/10 overall,0
I have had QC products for over 10 years now starting with the QC2 then the QC3,0
I got the Charge 2 a month ago and love it. It's easy to use and sounds great! Overall a wonderful product.,0
"wLY3ra  <a href=""http://znnkyneqacvs.com/"">znnkyneqacvs</a>",0
I bought these at a thrift for an impossibly low price and was amazed at how good they sound.  They literally put my old speakers to shame.,0
I received this as a late Christmas gift,0
The sound of the earphone was prefect. But i kept having the problem of loosing rubber ear piece. The rubber kept falling off,0
have had several par of the in ear headphones from Bose. Company stands behind their product and when the headphones went on sale I purchased two par. Use them for work and they are in my ears all day long and are very comfortable.   Tom W.,0
I just recently bought the headphones and it charges well. My only gripe is that the case isn’t always convenient to open with one hand.,0
Best thing JBL makes for my money. Can handle any type of music you throw at it,0

Looks so stylish in the lounge and the sound quality is excellent. The demo CD was like having an orchestra in the room. The quality of sound does not differ over the volume range. Well worth the money in every respect.,0

Bought an Anker for my wife and I bought me an JBL and my wife heard mine and tried to take mine away yes had to buy her own.,0
This is a nice sounding little speaker with Google Home control which hooks up easily and controls the smart devices in the home.  I do wish that it were wireless and that it could make phone calls. It is surprising that this speaker cannot make phone calls or work as a bluetooth speakerphone.,0
I travel a lot and now I can listen to music or my audio books with amazing clarity. It has made such a difference as I also find my ears don’t hurt now! I wish I had made the purchase sooner.,0

Words cannot describe how good these sound paired with my NAD 304 integrated AMP (35 watt continuous with 120 W dynamic power into 8 ohms).  I am not much of an audiophile per se,0
I put 4 of these in my 2004 F-150 Supercab. They are the best 5 x 7's by far. Tons of Bass for a small speaker. The mids are awesome and the Highs are extremly High. So clear,0
The JBL flip4 has been with me for about 1 year it still works in top condition and has good bass and is loud all the way up lives up to the water proof standard and was one of my Best Buy’s,0
This was a joint Birhday present to the pair of us and we love it. With different tastes in music we can compromise more easily. Love it.,0
This tiny speaker is great and awesome to have because how small can produce a high volume of music and also can carry it around.,0

Great choice i made to get this! not one single regret!!!! love it! High clarity,0
The sound is pretty amazing for something so small. It's very portable,0
I've always been a very light sleeper until I started sleeping with my Sleepbuds. Now I'm a deep sleeper. I've experimented a bit with them by varying the duration of sounds. I've found that having the sounds playing all night works best for me.,0
Very comfortable on head and ears. The sound was great and also it blocked out a lot of sounds outside to enjoy what your listening too,0
i was staffing camp when a buddy had some. he let e try them. i listened to then,0

This product is fantastic and exceeded my expectations 10 fold. The sound is brilliant and so easy to use and set-up.,0
These wireless in ear headphones are perfect! They fit me perfectly and don’t fall out and the sound is great! Enough bass and volume! So happy with these. They run on Bluetooth and last a good few hours before needing to b recharged.,0
I just bought this unit for my master bedroom and while it sounds decent it does not compare to my JBL ES250P. I recommend this unit for smaller rooms.,0
I have the TL1600 and two extra satellite speakers to make it a 7.1 system.  I owned a 5.1 and a 7.1 before and the sounds out of them doesn't even come close to the TL1600 .  I could hear the diference as soon as I turned them on.,0
Outstanding! I can't imagine why anyone would rate this speaker less than 5 stars. Awesome sound quality for the price. I love the ability to carry it anywhere,0
For 40 bucks they aren’t bad. The volume and skip buttons are in a different slightly awkward spot and are the same button which has been taking some time to get used to. But good sound and the wireless Bluetooth works up to a decent distance. Good headphones for the price,0
I got the JBL Charge 3 speaker for christmas and absolutely love it. The sound from this speaker is very clear. Only wish the bass/ sound was a little louder. Overall a great speaker!,0
I work for Circuit City,0
The soundsport sound great. Very clear and crisp. The reason for only 4 stars,0
These speakers pound. I had a pair of smaller polk towers and two bookshelf's as A&B. They don't even come close to the sound quality of the rti150's. Do not hesitate as I did for months,0
I bought this product to take with me to college and it's perfect!! So loud,0
I'm very pleased with these headphones. The sound quality is great while using the bluetooth adapter or the included cable. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for new headphones.,0

I have these in the front of my '93 Volvo and they sound great!  Im only pushing 45 watts to them and they have great clarity.  I plan on getting a 800watt 4 channel amp soon to boost the power for even more fun.,0

If you want a speaker for low to mid range listening this is an excellent buy. Very clear sound. If you are looking for a speaker to play loud music,0
I have only had this for one week and the sound is amazing! The sound is crisp and the bass is wonderful. It is a very loud sound in a portable speaker.,0
At first I was disappointed because me Extreme wasn't compatible with my Pulse,0
All I can say is WOW. This subwoofer is amazing. It has very tight and booming bass. I am using the LFE inputs so my experience may be better than some but I am very happy to have purchased this for my media room.,0
Bought one for myself and loved it.  Bought one for each of my adult sons and and their wives for Christmas.  Bought a second one for myself so I could have stereo.,0

When powered with an amp,0
The sound and quality of the QC35 Are by far the best on the market as i have tested most of the other headphones on offer. Battery life in amazing and they are so comfortable you could have them on your head for hours and not even know it.   One of the best tech buys I've ever made.,0
Love this device. Family really enjoys taking it everywhere. It sucks we can't connect it to out computers. Tried every angle to get it to connect. Oh well.   It'd be nice for movie nights on the laptop for the kids.,0
Like the performance of my jbl sb400. But I can't figure out why when I turn it off at night,0
ITS SMALL AND COMPACT,0

Heck yes! This is the best speaker ever. Sounds amazing. Battery life,0
I have had these for not so long,0
I bought these 12 months ago,0

Two is better than one? Why not!?  Really only buying another one to play around with the linked/connect/stereo mode,0
Good sound. Handy Google assistant. Shame about Netflix but not the end of the world. Would buy it again,0
I run almost everyday and these earphones stay in my ears perfectly. Throughout the past 6 months I have owned these devices,0

"Ef9Go8  <a href=""http://zafuwfxhotkd.com/"">zafuwfxhotkd</a>",0
These headphones have made my exercise routine or just casual lounging a full range experience. The sound comes across so realistically and these phones are made to be durable and comfortable.,0
I bought this to replace a smaller BT speaker at my office.  I bought the Onyx 1 as well and use that at home.  When I heard that poor little other BT speaker,0
This unit produces really nice bass and good sound overall. Google Assistant functionality works well.,0
This sub punds like a mother*****r...****.....i got  like 6 in my surburban and the **** on my block dont got ****... (naughty words edited out),0
FOR ME THE BEST ONE. I   USED MANY DIFFERENT BUT I  NEVER WAS HAPPY OF THEM. I LOVE MY JBL EVEREST 100,0
Over all it is an excellent by when you compare the sound quality to other similar priced self powered home subs.  I've owned the 600 for 6 months and have no complaints.  The remote is also a pretty sweet addition.,0
"I purchased this item for my hubby as a gift. He had another speaker and for the life of me I couldn't figure out why he wanted another one. Well the other speaker doesn't compare to JBL. It's ""All about that bass"".",0
Sound is great,0
The price is a steal. Are they the best? No,0
"sound is the most important and it is as good as BOSE. Very nice tone due to passive subs. Style and size are amazing for the sound. Cool machine. Priced absolutely right! Love the ""social"" setting",0

The ability to Bi-amp these speakers makes all the difference. True linear responce (I've RTA'd it),0
My God. These headphones are the greatest thing ever. I can not imagine a single way they could be improved. Their worth is beyond money. The space they create is magical. Buy them.,0
I got this on sale,0
I am using these speakers with Yamaha RX-V375 AV receiver. The sound is awesome. Clear and crisp sound. Highly recommend..,0
I use the System 10 for my acoustic guitar ,0
I've had this in my home theatre for 2 years now. I love it. The only drawback that I see is that I would love to have seen Polk Audio make a grill for the wall. Something nice with their LOGO on it.,0
A perfect match for 7300s.  Does and excellent job reproducing the demanding Center channel.  Excellent dynamic range,0
I bought it few days ago....i use it everywhere...cause music makes your life better...!!Lovely Regards,0
Purchased these for my husband who works in a large complex. He loves music and the sound quality and range of the wireless transmission is truly great! So happy with this purchase!,0
Very clean sound. The mids and highs are crystal clear with an amp. Well worth the money. The only reason that the bass isnt the best is because the woofer part is meant for mids,0
Got system on month trial,0
Bought these are Christmas gifts and they went over very well with the teenagers. The extension was an added bonus as well.,0
These are really nice sounding speakers for this price range. These are very bright sounding speakers to me. Almost to bright sometimes. I find myself lowering my treble level to compensate. I have them indoors though,0
these speakers are great. i use them for my front speakers,0
I bought this Bluetooth speaker about 2 years ago and it still works like the 1st day it's was purchased. Not to mention it's louder than that popular speaker made by that famous producer. (Wink).,0
I brought these a few months ago.....I have used them quite a lot and they have good across the spectrum sound and a really comfortable fix,0
I know its a little late for this speaker but I must say that the rt1000i and I am using 4 rt1000i's in my home with a hk avr7000 what a sound package I wish you could hear this speaker system very clean very good highs lows and mids I have all polk speakers center and sub. Loving it.,0

These things are incredible. These subs hit all the lows,0
I had this for a year now,0
JBL....you just can't go wrong! My parents have their speakers and I couldn't of went anywhere else. They have an amazing sound without having to add tons of components to them.,0
Than in my entire life combined!  I LOVE LOVE LOVE it!  Compact Easy to fit in pocket or purse,0
Just bought the soundbar 300 and the bass system,0
Purchased this 3 weeks ago,0

Two EX12's installed in 0.8cuft per sub acoustic suspension enclosure. 160W amp driving them. Overall sound and accuracy were outstanding. Took first place in local MECA competitions. Achieved 136.1dB with this very modest setup.,0
Love this speaker. Perfect for listening to my tunes when I'm grilling outside. My two little girls love the different light displays. Sound quality is excellent.,0
I bought these almost 2 years ago and they are still going strong! Phenomenal sound at such a low price!,0
i like everything about these earphones except they run out of battery a little too fast and the little cable clip falls off easily gettting lost. if you dont have this clip your earphones move around every where,0
It's the best speaker what i saw in this size. Sound is great!!! Works up to 12 hours (more longer than you said) Fast connect to iphone by pushing the power button. It's cool Light and always with me,0
This product exceeded my expectations in craftsmanship and sound quality. Haven’t passed half volume and the bass is just incredible. Would recommend to anyone. Also own a JBL charge 3 and Xtreme. New favourite line of Bluetooth Speakers.,0

Hi ... I bought it about 2 weeks ago ... And it worked nice until today that it shuts down every 5 minutes by itself ... What's the problem ?,0
I feel the Bose 3 had a deeper bass compared to Bose 1V. Bass is very important to me,0

Everything is good so far. However,0
Such good sound from something so small!Going to buy the Soundlink 3 for my main small living room speaker and move this about as required.,0
I have had the pleasure of using the HD400S for about a week and I love them. Call clarity is good and the control of music is also good. Considering the price point,0
I have owned Bose products for over 20 years,0
I got this product as a gift for Christmas. I could not be happier with this product. It works amazingly. The sound is so great,0
I have bought this product 4 different times. (all for different people of course) It's the ONLY way to go (sound quality has NOTHING to do with this product ) Obviously,0
I bought this three months ago and it is exceedingly comfortable and 8 can use it all the time it is amazing... I would totally recommend it to any future customers...,0
This was a Christmas present for my wife. She loves it  and me too. The only thing that she told me was that she wishes it would stand more easily.,0
So I bought this a few days ago to play basketball with and I was amazed how well these stayed on I was practicing contact shots and they barely got loose loose sure i had to adjust them occasionally mostly because of it irritating my ears but it didn't bother me that much,0

I absolutely love these earbuds.  Great sound and the fact they are wireless is amazing.  I have tried SO many earbuds in the past,0
I just received these headphones and they are excellent for workout and listening to music. The bose soundsport wireless headphones fit so comfortably and the sound is just crystal clear and great bass as well. These are totally worth every penny. I highly recommend this product.,0

it’s incredibly loud and definitely worth the price ! fit it in my sweatpants pocket and go on walks while jamming,0

I bought this device for my wife for her walking and gym activity. My wife who is not a electronics person such as my self is in love with the headset.,0
Excellent sound quality and noise cancelling. I bought these specifically for music and TV and they are of a very good quality. They fold up and come with a soft case for transport.,0

I bought this recently and was very surprised at how much umph you can get from such a small product. I love that it is waterproof and the battery life is wonderful.,0
Compare to other portable speaker by far it's the best one over all. One itsy bitsy tiny flaw.....THE PRICE! I was lucky enough to get it cheap! Retail price is bit too high! Other than that....BANG! Regardless where you are,0
I put 2 of these in a ported box with 1.0 cubic feet of air space,0
Walk almost every day for an hour. Haven't charged the battery in over a week since I started using it. Love the sound it produces!!,0
Excelent sub for the mony. you wont get two 12 inch subs that bump like these for even close to 100 bucks. I only have one hooked up so far,0
These headphones fit nicely in my ears. The sound quality is good. Only minus is there is not volume control.,0
I bought this a little over a month ago & I absolutely LOVE it!! I'm so happy that I decided to buy this!! :):) ♡♡♡♡♡,0
This is my second speaker and the volume,0
"I got these headphones when my ""Beats"" headphones fell off my lawn tractor and under the mower blades....I'm so glad I went the Bose route. They are crystal clear and sound awesome.",0
Just bought them about a week ago but really big improvement over my Jaybirds I just took back.  The sounds is much better and its a pretty stylish earpiece too.   I tried hard to get them to pop out and they stay in my ear which is a big deal.  Love the charging case,0
I love it!!! I use it all day at work or out at the disc golf course. The battery life is amazing. No complaints here. I also use to have a pair of the ear bus and they were awesome too.,0
Just received my new pair of headphones today. Already in love with the quality of the headphones and the clarity of the sound. Well worth the $350 can't wait until Bose releases a new set of headphones.,0
We installed these in my son's 2002 Mustang along with a new head unit,0
I bought this about 6 months ago and love it. The only thing is I wish the battery would last longer.,0
These headphones are so wonderful. Really comfy,0
The thing I like most about this product is the battery life. Lasts a long time,0
I can not be without music.   I carried this speaker to my office everyday as the sound quality is exceptional. It fills an enormous space with acoustic quality that is unparalleled.,0
I have enjoyed using this product,0
My husband purchased the Bose speaker for me,0
I bought this about a year ago and its really nice. could be alittle bit louder but for the size its great,0
I got the first quitecomfort 35’s for Christmas last year and they were amzing. Easily the best noise canceling headphones I have ever used. My pair got stollen out of my dorm room today.... so I upgraded and bought these. As a college student these will be one of the best investments you can make.,0
I was given this as a gift from a friend,0
Bought these to replace a set of G5s' as the rear surround,0
Bought this over a year ago and I have used it at work every single day for 6 hours minimum! This speaker is amazing! I am still using it and it works perfectly! Battery lasts around 6 hours on a charge! I would recommend Bose to anyone! Definitely will be purchasing more from here!,0
I was shopping for the Boston Acoustics component that is similar when I listened to the i-Sonic. The sound blew me away. I already own a Bose wave and when you compare them side by side the Bose sounds like an old transistor radio.,0
Very happy with purchasing. Was a nice addition to my other JBL Studio speakers. Easy set up and adjust. Bass is deep and accurate. Speaker is exactly what I expect from JBL ,0
I bought this as the colour matched our new kitchen worktop perfectly but,0
Excellent Speakers,0
After many years of struggling with earbuds that are painful or do not stay in place,0
Ok que the fat lady and give her a funky beat to sing to,0
I bought these when they were on a smoking deal and I am so glad I did! Great wireless earbud set. They were easy to pair with my phone and they are very comfortable. I'd recommend. Those who say they don't fit must not be putting them in correctly.,0
This is one of the best head phone I have ever used,0
"These speakers ""scared me",0
Mine will play three song maybe four but then it will stop receiving its connection with the Bluetooth phone. I tried it with my kindle HD 9.8 it acts the same way.,0
perfectly designed for whatever music you like. very tight,0
Received as a gift.  The best outdoor speaker there is!  Compact portable Bluetooth,0
Best sounding compact speaker out there. Volume is amazing,0
WOW,0
I bought it a month ago & I'm so happy i bought the best one thanks to bose for their sound engineering & adaptability,0
I LISTEN TO THE XRt12 EVERY DAY. OPTICAL CABLE TO A BOSE 6.1 SYSTEM. THE AUDIO QUALITY IS OUTSTANDING,0
Excellent sound and portability,0
The construction is reasonable and the over ear is comfortable - but could be a little more generous. However,0
I love these headphones they have been my best the sound is great i would recommend this to everyone good sound quality and comfort,0
I bought SoundTouch 30,0
Finally decided to invest my hard earned cash on my first Bose product,0
I brought this two days ago and so happy. I have many bose speaker systems such as wave radio,0
is a great affordable speaker wish i had spent the few extra bucks for the dxi 460p but over all a great product,0
It just works. I'm a photographer and it's my first companion while i retouch. The bluetooth range is impressive as well when i take bathroom breaks. Love it.,0
these speakers have awesome highs and mids,0
I bought this for my roommate for her birthday and I love it!  It is small yet loud.  I may buy one for my mom next!  I definitely recommend this speaker.  Also,0
I bought it $19.99. Sound is fantastic. I am happy. I am Korean. I Can't speak English well.  Thanks.,0
Unbelievable value from these people! I bought this to go with my Jamman guitar pedal. Unlocks tons of new possibilities.,0
The sound quality is very good and they are very comfortable to wear. Bought two and my daughter and I are extremely satisfied!,0
I bought this last January and went back last month to bought another and sent it to London England,0
lack of good look,0
Its my second Bose product.. and am happy to say that am truly satisfied with this !! Awesome sound quality and superb noise reduction.Good work guys !!!,0
these things really pack the punch. very crisp sound but if you want to crank it up these push out a lottttt of power,0
Great sound. You can easily fall asleep with these on. Perfect for long trips. However the USB connection can be touchy. My previous model’s connection became unstable until it went out. Bose did an excellent job replacing and honoring the warranty.,0
This are great speakers,0
i just bought these speakers and installed them last night an man they sound greati also used the  xtc baffles.  i have a phoenix gold 4 ch amp runing the intereors.  i have two kicker s12l7 run buy a phoenix gold 1200 watt amp and everything soumds great.,0
I just listened to those audios while playing music albums + watching movies at the same time into Private's Quiet Room > just like where am I at my local public library...,0
This little speaker packs a big punch.  I have JBL speakers in my SUV so I knew I could count on this one to fill my portable needs.  And you can't beat the price!  Highly recommend!,0
This adapter is absolutely great I love it. I have tried many things but nothing compares. Absolutely awesome,0
We added this to our T-Mobile account to make up for the Tap we bought last year. This speaker exceeded all of our expectations in terms of how well it projected the sound and that we can link it to similar devices. Excellent buy!,0
When the speakers arrived,0
I got mine for my birthday and i have to say,0
Bought this to replace my old home surround sound the sound is superb and not as obvious,0
Worked great and flawless until upgrading to iOS 8.3 Great product hence the 5 stars and can get around the fault by using the jack input. Apple at fault,0
Sound is amazing for such a small speaker,0
I LOVE THESE!!! Very comfortable,0
I brought this for my son and he loved it. great sound,0
I purchased this product a week ago and was not sure how much I would use it. I use it more then  any of my other 4 Bose speakers.  When I go to a Cigar Lounge I turn on my jazz and enjoy the wonderful sound and still able  have a conversation.  I recommend this product.,0
I listened to EVERY outdoor speaker available.  The sound and look -at this price- of the Atriums cannot be beat. I have the 45's on the deck,0
I bought one 8 months ago loved it so much I bought a second one last week,0
Bought two to mount in my Polaris Razr. I needed speakers that would link wirelessly. I was stoked when I found these and they worked just as advertised. Highly recommend.,0
I got this product in a very good deal. I usually JBL products. This one,0
I have never had such a great sounding set up in my life. The bass module added to the soundbar is amazing. You can actually feel the bass.  My teenage son also loves it.  I definitely would recommend bose to friends.   The design is also a plus,0
I bought this 2 weeks ago,0
I was SO fortunate to find these at a ridiculously low discount on Cyber Monday. These headphones provide the best wireless sound I have ever experienced. The touch functions operate flawlessly,0
bought this two years ago i think,0
I enjoy listening to podcasts while sleeping and don’t have to worry having ripped wires the next day! The downside is incoming phone calls is played on one earbud instead of both!,0
I bought this last month for my boyfriend and we loved it! Simple and perfect for someone who’s not looking to spend too much on headphones! And they’re pretty too!,0
Bought this last week after hearing one at friends party,0
Well as you all know these ROCK THE PARTY,0
You would think headphones would come with more than what looks like a roughly 8 inch cable for charging. A wall unit would be nice but at least provide a cable with enough length to be useable.   Other than that,0
so I've bought several pairs of these to give as gifts and I've had my own pair for over a year. I switched to these from Beats on ear and couldn't be happier. the JBLs are more comfortable,0
It's drive my Celling MC60 and the sound is very good,0
I put these speakers in my 1994 S-10,0
I bought 3 of these for Christmas gifts and they were a hit. Everyone loved them & the sound is clear & loud.,0
Great unit,0
They aren't the most comfortable on the ears however,0
How can people say they have had this for over a year when it just came out? This is a different product than the original Solo. I have not yet purchased but heard it in the store and it sounds great. I was amazed the sound came from the single unit.,0
Signed up for Spotify today after I was led to believe Alexa would work on this music app. Very disappointed to say the least as it does not act on command and only play via Bose Music app or bluetooth....Why advertise Alexa and Spotify if not compatible??,0
Just with all my other Bose products,0
Have used this for the past few months and I am still astounded by the richness & depth of sound from such a small item. Can transport from room to room with ease. Absolutely fantastic & well worth the price.,0
I've been a fan of Polk speakers since the early 90's and these A3s continue my love of Polk.  Very well designed,0
I've had the 120 for about a month and a half now. Super happy with the sound and no trouble with sub issues. I was looking to upgrade my old sound bar in the bedroom and came across a Bose demo station. The sound is like having a small movie theater in your bedroom. This system rocks!,0
Did my research,0
I have been looking quite a while for a good wireless speakers for my apple Mac Pro.....and I went back to the Apple store,0
The charge is a perfect addition to our golf game.  Fits great in a drink holder and keeps us going.,0
Great sound that gets plenty loud even outdoors.  The only issue on my Go is the battery discharges even when turned off.  So if i charge it up and don't use it for a week or so it will be deal when I try to use it.  I get around this problem with a portable battery pack.,0
This has great sound,0
I love not having a wire going to my pocket all the time! And everyone who sees them is always amazed!,0
The sound and fit is great. They hold tight when I jump and run around and the acoustics are crisp,0
I've had these headphones for about three weeks now. It's been so long since I've had a set of wired ear buds and I can say these are amazing. They sound great,0
This speaker is very loud for it's size and fills the whole room with sound! The bass is also very deep! Best portable speaker around! The bearts pill does not even compare with this product,0
I bought mine 3 months ago and I can not express how much I have liked them. I coupled my AM10 with Yamaha RVX 583 Av Receiver and in return I have one epic system. From watching movies to listening all music genres,0
Bought these for my daughter and she can't stop talking about how great they sound!!  She is also a stickler for comfort and these are fantastic for her.,0
First album I tested on those sweet things was Biosphere - autour de la lune. And i was amazed - just was looking at them and thinking where da hell this bass is coming from... They perform best at quite loud sound levels. Crisp and clear. Everything sounds just right.,0
I truly enjoys this speaker. It blue tooth connection is very nice. Also,0
The headphones are constructed well,0
I've been using these for about two years for podcasting. I've worn them for hours on end and they're comfortable the whole time. Sound quality is great,0
Purchased this speakers in 2016 for my electronics.works well till today.  perfect for the price and excellent quality sound out of all speakers i used.,0
Surprising clarity. The bass is limited,0

The Xtreme speaker has great quality and great sound. great for the beach and for outdoor parties,0

I bought these speakers as a replacement/upgrade of Logitech Z-2300 satellites. The improvement is big : better efficiency and much better sound quality. The sound is more warm and natural,0
After alot of searching for rear channel speakersa,0
When it comes to audio,0
bare good speaker ini,0
I bought it fron the JBL.com website a couple weeks ago. Like the sounds and the JBL app. It also works great with Spotify.,0
I just put these speakers in my Chevy cobalt and they sound great they replaced a pair of Sony xplods that I had very happy with the sound quality I can finally hear the vocals over my subwoofers,0
"Bought two for EON615. Seems to be a nice stand and holds the speaker firmly. The only thing that was disappointing was they came in a box thet said in larg letters JBL and directly underneath in the same size ""MADE IN CHINA"". I get it but kind of takes away the feel of buying the best.",0
This pedal crushes my other distortion pedals.. the introductory cost makes this the best deal so far..,0
fabulous. it has everything you look for in a wireless speaker. it is truly a home theater on its own. enjoy the party with the sound touch 30.,0
i use a different set of front speakers,0
Excellent product,0
These earbuds first caught my eye because of the amazing look and I bought them and they have even better sound quality unlike any other earbuds out there,0
I am not sure about negative reviews. Make sure volume is up on input device (iPhone,0
My TV speakers are not the greatest but this add the additional sound boost my TV needs. I love this.,0
I was looking for the best speakers available on the market compatible with Linux O.S and for my surprise,0
My husband and I love the clip! The sound quality is awesome! Perfect for a party by the pool or a morning getting ready in the bathroom! Great sound quality!,0
I bought this bt squeaker hoping it would be good gift for the wife. Aftering receiving it,0
I could not be happier with this system,0
Purchased the JBL Link 10 about a month ago and it is Absolutely Great!  Learning more and more about it everyday.,0
Nice aesthetics,0
I am amazed such excellent sound quality could be achieved with in ear headphones. I am more than pleased with them.,0
This is the best headset I ever owned. The sound quality is awesome. I am very happy with this purchase.,0
"I bought these although I already have and use the older non ""x"" version. I like them very much and especially like having the shorter non-coiled cable for wearing while mobile as well",0
Great sound from these very comfortable headphones. Battery lasts all day. Do yourself a favor and treat yourself or a loved one to these.,0
I bought this a month ago to replace my other JBL sub that got damaged in a move.  I was already happy with the other one but little did I know what I was missing out on.  I love the sleek contemporary design and the clear crisp bass that accompanies my music,0
Paired with my Samsung S6,0
I bought 1 because I was skeptical of its sound quality...after listening to it connected to laptop I was so impressed that I bought 3 more to give as gifts. my moms cat knocked it off the table onto the floor and it did not bother it at all.....still plays great.,0
I got this speaker for Christmas and I am extremely happy with it! It is very loud and sounds great playing all types of music especially hip pop. It has great bass and doesn’t distort at high volumes. I love that you can pair it with other JBL speakers,0
Love my Wave system! Sounds great! I would have liked if it actually came with the cable so I could connect my device to the Aux in Connector! I guess I will have to ask Santa to bring me the the Bluetooth wireless connector.,0
Received this for Christmas from my wife.  Hooked it up and made some sound adjustments on the tv and bass and away we go!  Bluray sounds amazing on this,0
I was given one of these as a Christmas present last year. Now the speaker won't charge!!! Since it was a gift I don't have a receipt OR a warranty. Totally bummed. Second guessing giving them out as presents because fear it's a deficient product over time.,0
I brought this QC35 II yesterday and it’s one of the best headphones I have ever brought!! Would definitely recommend this headphone,0
I was looking for a pair of sunglasses. I picked these up and was amazed by the new technology. If you are on the fence,0
I purchased this system a few days ago and it hasn't missed a beat. A bit of room placement with the sub and I was away! It works great with my Onkyo receiver and it was so easy to set up! Well worth it!,0
I have the T20e version of the Monitor 30's. Great economical speakers! Please see my comments listed under the PSW 10 reviews.,0
Impressed at the sound quality and output of these... paired with a subwoofer they provide a rich full spectrum sound. Lovely discreet design as well,0
I bought this as a gift to my girlfriend and she loves it!! Music sounds really good from this speaker. This very much worth it!!,0
I love my Polk....it is small,0
Its my first speaker an i have no problems,0
I have been using my noise canceling earbuds for 2 years and LOVE them! I will not travel without them! It blocks out the noise of the world around you on the airplane or train. I get so much more done and am relaxed at the end of the trip! It is a MUST have in my carryon!,0
I am the owner of 2 wave systems 2 more than 5 years. The sound is great and I never have any problem with them. Expensive but worth the money. Great product.Thank you BOSE.JJ,0
Amazing,0
Works great,0
This Sub was Free with Polk promotion...I bought the RTi 10 speakers...Called Polk Tech for proper hook-up on the Sub. Ecellent Service from the Tech........... Sounds GREAT!!,0
I needed to replace factory speakers with something better. Clarity with the Gt7-86 is unbelievable and brings out the richness in the music. I would never use anything else.,0
This is a fantastic little speaker even if it's a little bit heavy but that's because of the quality of the build and design of this speaker but once you start using this beautiful speaker all that matters is the perfect sound quality that this produces just pure magic.,0
the people complaining about to much bass just move the speaker away from the wall and you will get less bass it just depends on where you have the speaker placed in the room.,0
I purchase this sound bar based on previous purchases of JBL products and have not been disappointed. The ease of installation was great. The sound is far better than what I expected since I have a surround sound system for my main TV and this purchase was for a bedroom TV.,0
Great speaker,0
I have the Bose Wave II with the sound link adapter. This was the first of three Bose purchases. I really enjoy the sound. I use it for the radio and to stream music online or from my MP3 collection. Seldom if ever use the CD changer. I highly recommend this product.,0
"It looks good It's also well built.It protects the speaker from knocks and bangs when travelling.Over all it's a high quality case that does the job.Thank you ""Bose""",0
I love this Bose Bluetooth Home Speaker.  The bass and treble are amazing!!!!!! It sets up really easy and simple and I love the way it makes my music sounds.  This one is a winner!!!!! Great job Bose!!!!!!!,0
I love these speakers. But highly disappointed that you can't connect multiple speakers(only2). I received a 3rd speaker as a gift and as of right now its useless to keep.,0
good quality speakers with good crankabilty and sound great the only thing I didnt like was that the bass wasn't that great otherwise they would have been 5 stars!,0
Awesome sub!!!  I've got three of them in the back of my '99 S-10 Blazer,0
I just bought a pair with 500 bucks,0
I have had my fair share of earphones by many brands in my life but this seriously beats all of them!!,0
Put a pair of these in my boat powered only by the deck. I cant even hear the clarions that were put in there! Crank them while full throttle and still hear with great quality!,0
The first pair was faulty. After 8hrs charge would hold for 2hrs,0
I love the sound quality of the soundbar and I'm berry happy and satisfy with the design love it and yes I'll recomend to all my family and friends to buy it...,0
Unbelievably Durable!  My SoundLink fell out of my car (don't ask how) while I was going 15mph - I was shocked!  It had minor scratches & road debris on it,0
I have had my speaker for about 4 months now. It has excellent sound. It is light. I carry it to any room in my house and put it in my pool tote. It easily links to my iPod and iPhone. The only drawback is that I wish it had a remote.,0
I enjoy these Headphones while travelling and /or waiting for service in various venues. It cancels out noise,0
My cousin has one,0
I bought this about a month ago on Black Friday.  It's easy to use and the quality sound is what you'd expect from JBL.  I also own the larger Flip 4,0
Bought this speaker for my husband and it is fabulous. It's small so that makes it easy to carry anywhere. It also has great sound quality!!,0
Purchased many different wireless earbuds before landing these.  Noise cancellation is superb.  Can wear these all day with no discomfort.  Only drawback is sound could be a little better.  I found that if i use an equalizer app on my iPhone,0
I've had it for a couple weeks now it's amazing. The sound is great. It fills my kitchen and it looks nice.  People come over and can't believe the speaker sounds so good. The only thing bad about it is no Apple Airplay yet.,0
Wonderful versatile surround speaker. Just set surround speakers to small on source output,0
So clean sounding. Sound great in a sealed enclosure. Carry high volume very well. They hit so hard they make your eyeballs vibrate.,0
I was surprised at the great sound such a small device could produce. My go to sound system at home,0
esperaba con gran expectativa la llegada de mis rti A7. me parecen unos parlantes fant?sticos,0
I bought this speaker in 4 14 2017 along with the LG aristo I'm glad I did the speaker has a booming sound and it's water proof sand proof awesome,0
I picked this sub up on a Black Friday special and it was worth every penny. I was speptikal that it would not produce because of the price. This sub was worth every dime and sounds great.,0
So happy I bought these today from the Leeds store. They don't look too big on the ear. The sound is crystal clear. Bluetooth connectivity is great. I can wander around my whole flat without any loss of reception. Best of all,0
We had limited space in our cabinet,0
absolutely love these headphones- sound quality is amazing,0
Best sounding small tower speaker in Circuit city listening room. Can handle power w/o distorting. I guees it is being discontinued,0
I initially bought these headphones for traveling - I recently started wearing them at night because my significant other snores loudly. I sleep like a baby with them in and I’m no longer woken up by his obnoxiously loud snores!,0
Love my new speaker! Sounds great,0
I have buy this 15 OCt 2018 and it is mind blowing. Amazing bass effect. With my new SoundTouch 300 Bar. And sorrond sounds. Its completely cenema theatre sound effects in home also. Thanks BOSE,0
I am obsessed with this product! Has amazing sound quality and the app that they recommend you download to work with your headphones is very helpful and a great feature. I already told my boyfriend that I want to get him a pair,0
I bought this speakers ten years ago.  It works as well as on the first day.   I am happy with them.,0
Ottimi diffusori,0
I am a light sleeper and for the 4-weeks I have had my Sleep Buds,0
After my 10's were stolen in '87,0
Hello,0
Exactly what I was looking for. Tried Bose. Too big and bulky. Sonos quality had fuzzy noise on high volume and the hype isn't much for it. Also pricey. However,0
"I couldn't be happier. I bought the DXi to replace my 10"" MTX Thunder 8000. Bass is outstanding. It also looks good. I'm sure it will sound even better when I put it in a bandpass box as opposed to the sealed box it's in now.",0
These are great headphones with solid soundproofing. The twist to fit action takes some getting used to,0
Fast set up! I love the idea that it works. No reciver no speaker wires. I set up the my remote to work with it in 20 sec.,0
I love this subwoofer! It cost me 48 dollars and it sounds like a $200 sub. Sounds amazing and pushes bass like nothing.,0
I have never heard a better system using only 1  Dxi112 subwoofer it sounds like you have about 3 10 inch subs its perfect for any car/truck,0
Set up under a 55 inch TV in a 30 x 26 family room ...outstanding audio... easy to use... I Bluetooth my iPhone music thru the sound bar and get awesome results... great value for money,0
THE PRECISE AND MAGNIFICENT SOUND AND BASS QUALITY IS SPECTACULAR AND REJOICING. I THINK THIS SPEAKER IS ONE OF THE BEST.,0
Nice speaker system.  Delivers crisp highs from the speakers and nice lows from the sub.  When watching movies this system fill the room with sound,0
This really changed the sound of my whole system. Sound smooth and is not harsh. Very effectively brings the soundstage to the front and higher. The crossovers that come with the tweets filter out any lows and mids very well.,0
Great little product,0
Wonderful little speaker that fills a small room well. Replaced Bose 201s with these and noticed an immediate increase in clarity and bass response.They are the mains in my home theater and I am very pleased.,0
I bought it tonight,0
Hubby bought 2 months ago. I want one niw BUT .... I am after a digital radio alarm clock. Is there a digital radio upgrade in the pipeline? If so I will definitely be buying one.,0
I got this speaker as a Christmas present. I literally danced for an hour or more straight non-stop just testing it out. It sounded so good that I couldn't sit down! I am tickled to death.,0
I bought this based on the features and price.  The ear buds are too big for me.  I would like to exchange for the women's inspire 100.  I think that will be a much better fit.,0
Absolutely love these. The noise cancelling is incredible! Battery life is amazing. Really happy. I got the limited edition blue. Very nice color. Ive become a fan of Bose! Have quite a few of their products too.,0
The charge has become our default sound source. Great for vacations & at home we end up taking it fr room to room. Sometimes hard to link a new device.,0
The sound is fantastic and I love the design. They're light and fold up nicely so easy to take around. However,0
I brought these about a month ago. Quality sound. Excellent price. Will buy again.  Highly recommended.,0
I bough the 300 sound bar and 300 base and all I needed to do is hook it up with a fiber optic cable to the TV and it has great sound for everything played on the TV,0
Have to agree with all other great reviews. Sound quality is spot on. Anyone who has been in my company and seen this little beauty has either wanted one or gone out and got one. Amazing bit of kit.,0
I've had it for almost a year and my family borrows it for oaries/get together.  My sister borrowed it and doesn't want to return it anymore lol,0
I lost my aux cable about 9 months ago,0
The SoundTouch adaptor has breathed new life into my beloved analogue hi-fi set up and simultaneously created a link between the old and the new equipment that I use everyday.,0
Wasn’t expecting much since it’s smaller than other Bluetooth speakers I’ve had in the past but when I first used it I was blown away and couldn’t have been happier,0
I have had many bose systems and this one is the best yet. The sound over the years keeps getting better and better. They systems last a long time and its non-stop awesome sound.  Thanks Bose for making this your premium product.  All I ask is to start making them in the USA again.,0
I lost one of my earphone pads a few weeks ago,0
The only problem is battery last about four hour,0
i love how well they fit in my ears. the problem is,0
Got this great piece yesterday  and loving it already.  Just that I wish it came along with ear piece tucked in so I could have some privacy when picking a call without worrying about who could be listening in on my calls.,0
This tiny speaker is awesome and connects well to our devices. My husband loves this early stocking stuffer :),0
I bought this for my wife as a Christmas gift. She absolutely loves it! It truly makes listening to music more enjoyable. Amazing sound quality!!,0
These wireless headphones sound absolutely amazing!  I walked upstairs in my house and they never lost the Bluetooth connection.  They are so comfortable and I don't feel like they will ever fall out.   I have owned many headphones and these are by far the best yet.,0
Already had the Flip,0
Amazing sound with all the smart features I want. Looks really cool and works perfectly with Google assistant.   Before long my whole house hold,0
I bought this in July of 2015,0
Compact,0
Great headphone the notice cancellation is very good I recommend for everyone to try it because he will not regret it,0
AMAZING .. I got them for and they're just great. The sound quality is amazing even when you turn the volume up to the maximum and the subwoofer is really good for a 8 inch,0
Perfect ear fit.  Comfortable. Great sound Noise cancelling  Neck piece too tight.  If your neck is small than perfect for you.,0
I love this radio.  It's extremely easy to set up,0
I love this so much I got one for my husband too. He kept taking mine when he traveled without me. The only reason I am not giving it a 5 Star rating is the cord is flimsy and broke right off within a month and now I have to get a replacement. I guess I better order two of them.,0
Comfortable and well made headphones,0
I bought these for my son he loves them they are well designed and very durable can be used in most items and they come with stickers so they can decorate them how they wish which creates great entertainment.,0
Excellent little speaker. Looks feels and sounds great. Lives up to the great reputation of Bose. Easy to set up and get going. Worked well with iPhones and galaxy tablet.,0
I've had my audiosource technica headphones for a long time now the sound is amazing and the building quality is excellent for the price these are a great set of headphones. They will never fail,0
This is the biz.... The sound quality is out of this world. And the connectivity by Bluetooth is great.,0
I got  four of this droped in a custom built box for the front of my quad and i love these speakers they got very deep lows,0
I got this for my birthday and I absolutely loved it. My favorite thing about is how I can program it to all my favorite seriousXM channels with the app.,0
I recently got the deal of the century by purchasing this set in mint condition from someone who said they had upgraded. Upgraded to what? Anyone who craves perfect sound for music or video has to buy this system. You will love yourself. Bose step to the back of the line. I am a former Bose owner.,0

I absolutely love these earbuds. I have pathetically sensitive ears and these are one of the few pairs of earbuds that don't hurt them. Also,0
I absolutely love the smaller earplugs. They are great for women or anyone who has small ears. They're extremely comfortable and they don't fall out! Highly recommend!,0
Just got this home and the fit feel and build quality is well worth the 109$ in IL.  Quick pairing,0
Purchased month ago from bose store. Too gud very soft crystal clear notes at max volume or at min volume. Simply awesome,0
Got these cool speakers for $30. It has a great sound and worth the money. Battery life is only for 5 hours. But over all its amazing. Money well spent.,0

Just bought Revolve+ at Best Buy (same price as Amazon without the wait). The sound is simply amazing.  High highs and deep lows. Based on its smallish size I was not expecting this much sound. Place it in a corner and let the walls amplify the sound even more. Well done Bose.,0
I work in a loud environment,0
I just bought 2polk 2124 and I think that they are very hard hitting twelves. They hit way harder then my brothers two cerwinvegas!,0
Great sound,0
Awesome headphones,0
Finally bought myself QC35,0
Bought it seven years ago,0
The highs are quite clear,0
Great sound from such a small package. About as thick as a soda can,0
The sound is very good.  The fit is better than other wireless earphones that I’ve tried but I would prefer a snugger fit - especially since these are heavier than my previous wireless pair.  The rechargeable case is very cool.  Overall a good buy.,0
I bought this on Friday,0
this is a very god speaker to have at home or in a car. i got this one at home to my surround system and it gaves a lot of bass.this bass can i play with  very low effect and it still bassing god,0
So far so good. Best wireless I’ve owned. Great sound although they take a lot of volume to get cranking. Battery is decent also. I’d recommend these.,0
Background professional drummer and I have gone through a variety of vocal stand and floor monitors and have found the m3t has proven to be more reliable. The sound quality and range are very good. The monitor is very easy to set up.,0

Ideal when traveling by plane ,0
Am a great fan of Bose products,0

I've owned these since new and never looked back. Hands down,0
Got the Cinemate 15 system last weekend.Watched a lot of movies on it and listened a lot of songs.Has a good amount of deep bass without any distortion.Very happy with it.,0
I feel those who seem to think the midrange is weak need to look at their components.  With my nad amp and nad cdp and tuner their is no midrange problem what-so-ever.  Maybe you boys need a better amp with more power?,0
I just got these speakers and they are great not a single thing wrong with them.Plus i got an amp for em and WOW even better.I tell all my friends to buy polk speakers.,0
I bought yurbuds ITX-2000 and they are phenomenal!!!  When I received the reflect contour and I was expecting the same quality JBL has always provided.  I have Motorola and Plantronics Bluetooth headsets and the JBL reflect contour BLOWS them out of the water.  No contest.,0
I just got it today at Best Buy. Works very well but you have to get USB port sound card. The sound quality is amazing.,0
This really is the best thing since sliced bread. I LOVE my soundlink mini - the sound quality is AMAZING.,0
Own a few different polk speakers. This one,0
these subs SLAP... they play loud and deep and sound clean.. and for anyone to say these subs are not good makes them a hater. i am very satisfied with these subs and must say they dooky on many other subs.,0
I've had enjoyed these headphones for over a month. I use them for running (1 mile sprints to 6 mile long easy runs). They sync well with my iphone 6,0
The Clarity and Smoothness of the treble cant be matched!!! i have my polks hooked up to a sony xplod cd player and no matter how loud i turn it the treble WILL NOT distort.,0
The colors are nearly as vibrant as the sound quality! I recently purchased one of these and the sound is phenominal. The portability and the simplistic design make this a 10/10 for me.,0
I think these have nice bass response...nice separation...a cool airiness to the music as if it were live..,0
I´ve one and used it under many years,0
I bought this because I was looking for a headset that was light,0

I brought these a week before a trip and I tried them several times they are awesome for cheap headphones they have great sound and are very comfortable,0
Works great I would give it 5 stars but the Ear piece does not have enough cushion and creates a sore in one ear. I have to add cotton around to to prevent this from happening g,0
These headphones have great sound quality and are very comfortable to wear. It is very simple to sync them to your device via the bluetooth and start listening. The batteries last about 6 hours before needing to be charged again. Overall great headphones!,0

I wish I'd bought this sooner,0
I purchased these for my beach house a few years ago and they still work perfectly. They sound Huge and SoundTouch is a dream,0
Very happy with my JBL Clip.  I listen to books when walking or working around my home and do not like having a Bluetooth in my ear all the time. This works for me quite well.,0

The experience is great & lovely. The purchase and delivery was easy. The delivery was before the committed date.,0
JUST LOVE THE SOUND. GREAT BASS,0
I pride my self in sound quality and have been listening to jazz and RB for a very long time. This BOSE Sound Link 3 is off the chain when listening to music from my tablet. I would highly recommend this speaker with confidence that you can not go wrong owning this product. Thanks BOSE!,0
I bought this a few weks ago and one sight my friends came around just to watch me with it.  A crowd pleaser.  Thanks!,0
We have had this JBL Flip for awhile and we just love it,0
I purchased this speaker for my son to use with his ipod in his bedroom,0
I've bought plenty of ear phones and always thought they were good,0
I actually like these little amps. Don’t let the 250W power fool you. The Power these amps produce is clean and the amp is lightweight. Bose makes it simple and quick to hook up and it has a cool carrying case.,0
These speakers do their job very well. They look very nice ( matched them with a JBL sub ) and as always with JBL,0
I bought this a month ago. It works really good. Only one disadvantage that I found is having 30pin dock. But 30pin to lightning adapter costs around $10 only.,0
I bought this to replace an older model and am very happy with my purchase the sound is excellent and it retains more than one blue tooth connections at a time.,0
Seriously would not wear anything else,0
I have QC3 headphones and the ear cushions are shot.  I Bose offering free replacement ear cushions?,0

I recently got these for my 5yr old daughter to use with her iPad. They are comfortable,0
I bought the first pulse about a year ago and I absolute loved it. When the Pulse 2 came out I was hesitant in upgrading. But I am so glad that I did!!! This was a great upgrade. All the added features are amazing. Great item!!!,0
Works great for apple products. I love my QC15,0
I recently installed 2 pair in a Camry and they really scream!! These are the cleanest sounding speakers at high volumes. Matched with a DB1212 in the trunk completes the sound greatly. Great job Polk! I'll definitely recommend these to my customers and friends.,0
Loved the product but hated the limited sound library....until the new update which included new sounds and a “sound library” to manage my sounds! I wish I could upload purchased sounds from my iTunes....hopefully  that will happen soon!,0
this product is really good from bose and the best feature is soundtouch and the speaker has that punch which no other speaker can have for this price,0
This is my secondd QC25 and I love it. I routinely take mine on the 30-hour flights to India and fatigue is almost non-existent because I hardly ever hear the aircraft engines. And the music is crisp. As much as I love music this is a godsend.,0
I bought a year ago,0
This speaker has some amazing sound for as small as it is. I could be 30 feet away and still hear it plain as day!,0
I am really happy I purchased this speaker,0
Listen if you are going to buy headphones from Bose they have to be noise cancelling,0
But this JBL Xtreme Bluetooth speaker about 2 weeks ago and very impressed with the sound and battery life,0
Very lovely cam it’s very easy to use not complicated like the other ones easy menu ,0
These are the best headphones I've ever owned! They're multi functional and perfect for the office,0
this is a totally awesome sound box as I have tried sound bars before but they are no patch on the sound this puts out.only one drawback is the remote looks a bit cheap.well done bose for a great product.,0
Just bought this speaker today and had it hooked up in no time. Very easy to pair with my iPhone. The Aux. jack enabled me to hook it up to my computer as an external speaker. Very versatile unit,0
Fantastic multimedia speakers at an affordable price. I own Bosch and Klipsch on my other computers and they are great too. But if your Budget is Tight PEBBLES are the answer GREAT Highs and Lows with FANTASTIC midrange.,0
I am thoroughly pleased with this purchase. The quality of sound was excellent and more than I expected in this price range. These units are well constructed and quite heavy. I would not hesitate to recommend to anyone.,0
While this headphone performs as expected,0
Just what I was looking for! It is portable and a great companion with my tablet! I am a radio-podcast freak,0
"Wow these 3.5"" are AMAZING! I put them in my dash with no amp hooked up",0
I have been waiting to upgrade for years. I finally found what I was looking for w/ the rm6600. I don't have the sub,0
I just purchased the Atrium 45's for my family room to use as main stereo only speakers. They sound fantastic! A huge sound in a small box. Forget about Bose.,0
I've had my RTi38's for a year and a half now. I have never regretted my decision to buy them. Bass,0
I bought these for gym use only. I do sweat a bit and workout about 75-90 minutes at a time. No issues with the headphones falling out and the sound is outstanding. Good cord length so I can run it under my shirt all the way to my iPod that is attached to my waist band of my gym shorts.,0
I have had them 2months . Love them. Just wish the ear piece was smaller.  I have small ear openings and the left one will not stay in while I run.,0
See their pictures you may think it just another cheap plastic speaker but let me tell you that first ,0
Bose will always deliver that crisp clear sound they are known for,0
After searching for a lower priced speaker with good sound quality I came across the Flip 2. This little speaker packs a big punch. Awesome sound and affordable.,0
Pros. - best sub around $200. Cons. - For <30 Hz needs more space to expand a lot of air.And when you listen something lower than 30 hz bass closes in sub.And you don't hear anything but box sound.If PSW505 have little bigger phase inverter.i think this sub was legendary.,0
i have bought the first JBL flip then the Pulse,0
Bought 2 pairs of these and love them. Just ran a 7k on Saturday and they stayed in the entire time never felt like they were falling out. Would definitely buy again. And the sound quality is great also.,0
Good speakers and sound quality is good when connected to phone. Was not allowing me to control volume when playing songs through you tube. strap on back is good feature to hang it on shower curtain rod/something similar.,0
very good sound,0
Love the feel of these in the ear.   They are not too bulky of an earphone.  The only improvement I would make is to make them longer.,0
The small size feels a little too big for my ear. I went online to see if they had an small size but they don't. Putting them on takes some effort.Other than that I like the product.,0
This is a really great speaker -- you can actually play it full blast and the speakers won't blow! Love it,0
Beautiful product.  Very good sound,0
If you want a sub that that can handle some serious home theatre and make the bottom end of CDs come alive then this is the one that can handle the task.,0
I have own two BOSE systems and I absolutely love them! I also own a pair of noise cancellation headphones! Bose definitely has superior quality of sound!! I recommend BOSE for anyone making a choice about quality equipment for their listening pleasure!,0
I bought this for my husband and he loves it!!   He wants to mount it to his utility vehicle for the ranch. Great sound!!!,0
I love long road trips on the bike. Now I don't have to listen to drone of an exhaust any more than I want to. I'm able to mute out a 115 decibel motorcycle with these. Most importantly the aware mode allows the ability to hear what's going on when riding in the city. Very happy with the investment!,0
An excellent speaker,0
I challenge anyone to show US a better speaker for under $100. GREAT job JBL........didn't expect any less.,0
I have had these headphones for a few weeks now and they are brilliant. Great base response,0
Very pleased with this system.  Got it for around $400.  Great sound quality for someone looking to set up a home theater for around $800.  The sub has pletty of power even though it is rated at 50 watts.  Make sure you have an extra set of speaker cables because of the way the sub hooks up.,0
Love this system! I used to have a 3.2.1 system decided to upgrade to this system so much better,0
Absolutely brilliant sound from the JBL Charge 3,0
"Great speakers!! They have great low bass and clear highs. I have fallen in love with them. Put them in a 10x14 bedroom and they will shake the walls. Added a 10"" subwoofer and now i have the perfect system in my room.",0
I am delighted with the earphones but wanted to change the buds from the medium (fitted) to the small,0
I bought is two month ago and I found it really nice. I lived in an apartment,0

I used this for running outdoor and on machines.  I have used other wireless earbuds and corded ones,0
I have had my speaker a few months now. The sound is incredible,0
Purchased my Bose 301 speaker set in 1993 while on active duty military. These speakers are still kickin just like new. Bose will have a hard time exceeding the performance of the 301 series,0
Sounds & looks great.  Easy Bluetooth connectivity & syncing to other JBL speakers. I have it a five star on value only because I got it on sale.  Otherwise list price is too high.,0
I got a set of these before xmas 2018 and I was blown away. Dont waste money on beats. Buy these!!!!,0
If you are looking for wired headphones that sound great and stay in while running,0
These headphones have a clear,0
Love this little speaker. Sounds great. Compact size is easy to take anywhere.   Only issue is I wish the blue tooth capability was a little further. Speaker has to be in pretty close proximity to the blue tooth device.,0
Although I have had to wait nearly 2 months to receive the product - it has been well worth the wait! The sound is amazing,0
The best earbuds that I have ever had. I bought these earbuds when they were on sale wish I would have purchase several of them.,0
This work very with my Pioneer multi-channel receiver and Infinity center speaker,0
These speakers rock!! They play loud and clear.  In my opinion,0
I purchased these for some kids and they love them. I tried them out and they sound clear and they are comfortable. The small bag is a bonus and the offer to provide additional ear pieces if the ones you receive are not comfortable make this a super deal.,0
Big win:  My Studio is filled with powerfull and christal clear sound. All my party guest asked me,0
I took a flight trip in a military plane (C-17) in a 18 hours flight I was so please to have my Headphones. I was able to listen to music as well watch few movies with out any issues,0

Just bought this system to simplify my audio components and love it. Its so simple to use,0
Great set of speakers. I had the Alpine Type S 5X7's and these are a night and day difference. They compliment my MM6 momo components quite well. They dropped right in without modification in my 2001 Taurus. A+++ Very clear sounding,0
Looking for an amp that provides great bass without sounding muddy and overpowering a room?  This is the one I'd pick.  For me this amp proved that bigger wasn't needed to be better.  It's small and yet it packs a great punch.  Perfect bass for music and always seems to surprise me during a movie.,0
So I loved the flip 3,0
USB charging port is excellent,0
I brought these 2 and a half years ago.   Love them,0
Just charged it up and it works fine and think it sounds good .Bought this item refurbished .It doesn't have a mark on it and you would think it was brand new! Comes with a one year warranty from Harmon Cardon.Hope it lasts a long time.,0
The best system for the condomunium owner,0
I bought this for my 5 year old son for Christmas.  The quality and overall product is exceptional especially for the price.,0
I have a 1998 Toyota Camry. I replace all of the factory speakers with polk audio speakers,0

Hi. I just bought the jump model but the left earphone is not working,0
Simple to assemble,0
The JBL Charge 3 Case is a convenient case to you. It stores the JBL Charge 3 inside the case and it is a durable case. I would recommend this case to anyone who has a JBL Charge 3.,0

The Flip3 is a fantastic deal from a cost,0
We used the RC6S Polk speakers in a Dental office to direct sound above patients during exams and in small waiting rooms plus reception and office spaces with individual keypads for every speaker. Great sound in every location. Thank You for your dual imput speaker,0

Great earphones,0
Just bought this and it is unbelieveable. Sound is great,0
i bought it after my trip manila the first trip messed up my ears/hearing then the second trip w/ bose - no hearing problems and they pack everything w/ bose 35 for plane comfort.,0
Clear sound and good performance but Insufficient bass. It's good for Pop music rather than Classic music.    It's awesome Wired and Bluetooth 2 way connectivity.  Cute design,0
System sounds good. Satallite speakers crackle when played in Dolby Digital DTS 5.1(with certain movies) For the money it's a good system.,0
I've used the headphones for the last 2 months. They really cover the range of sound bass through tremble very well.They are als quite comfortable.,0
Just installed 2 pairs in a F-150 ext cab today. Its still early but my initi6al impression is good. Good tone across the board.,0
Superb.  I've had the RT1000 for 7 years and they are as good as ever.  I routinely check-in on other manufacturer @ friends and the sound doesn't come close.  I'm going after the center and surround sound to round out my lot.  Polks are fantastic!,0
**Center of bass** .....iHave'nt even pushed it wide open yet and the lows had me greatly satisfied. I just upgraded from the TSi CS 20. And I thought that was a great center. But this bad boy took the cake. It's worth the extra bread if you where thinking about the A4.,0
I was hesitant to spend the money for a set of earphones but have not regreted it. Very comfortable for hours and great sound.,0
I got these in Canberra,0
Really good product,0
I really like the JBL Xtreme. It's really loud and it has an incredible battery life. But,0
These are the only earbuds that never fall out of my ears.  Sound is great,0
I bought my SoundTouch 30 speaker yesterday. I cannot believe the awesome sound that comes from this speaker. It fills my living room with great tones and the bass....wow. I love this speaker and will soon purchase another one to link in my studio.,0
Bought this item a few weeks ago. Shipping was super fast. Small size and yet very powerful. Sound quality is loud and crisp.  Highly recommended.,0
I bought them a week ago. Battery life is great. Super comfortable. Sound is clear and crisp. Only negative is the bass is lacking. I adjusted my eq on my phone,0
I put four of these in our party school bus (full sized school bus).  Fed 75 watts rms 150 watts max from a cheap Sony Amp. These things blow the doors off.  Adding a sub soon,0
I bought this a month ago and it still thrills me blasting it loud. If u don’t like loud music it’s not for you,0
Absolutely amazing sound quality! I am no expert when it comes to music,0
Added 4 speakers inceiling for Atmos configuration 7.1.4. I notice tremendous improvement to audio delivery. The swivel tweeter to the direction of listening makes the audio better and adheres to Atmos recommendation. Great speakers!,0
Been using them over couple of months. The variety what you can do with these headphones sound-wise is mind-blowing. Excellent!,0
Have had these in my car for about a year and they still sound great and look brand new. They have great bass for a 6.5 inch speaker and the highs notes are good and clear as well as everything in between.,0
These are great,0
I bought this little doozie about 5 to 6 months ago. Received it,0
"Awesome amp. Very flexable preamp section. Took my 8volt input with no problem. Have it powering two Polk/Momo MM2124 (12"") in a .92ft3 box. They pound. Best amp I have owned so far.",0
Best earbuds I’ve ever had! I left them outside on  accident in the freezing snow and I found them the next day and they worked like they were brand new!,0
I LOVE Music & If You Are Any Kind Of Music Person You Will LOVE The Sound That Emminates From These Cans. Buy A Pair Now!!!,0
They weren't lying when they said it last 12hrs (unless yur charging something) The bass is powerful & it is very loud. I am very satisfied with my product. Thank you JBL,0
I bought this speaker today,0
"I am impressed with the size of this speaker! 9"" in height and 3"" wide",0
I bought this speaker today.  It's really great,0
I just picked these up and the sound quality is amazing along with its great bass,0
Absolutely nothing comes close to these speakers. Clean,0
These headphones are definitely worth the money you pay. I am very pleased with the sound quality,0
I have this small speaker...it does have a great volume and excellent sound,0
This is a great sounding speaker. Certainly allot of bang for your buck. I have over 3,0
Bought this on a whim and couldn't be happier...exactly what I was looking for.  Small and compact yet the volume will get extremely loud.  This will be my new travel Bluetooth go to!,0
Excellent speaker,0
Just bought it today in the Bose shop in Hangzhou China where I live. Could not wait to get it home and listen. I am delighted with its rendering of pop and classical. I will be listening to it a lot.,0
Unleash your music,0
I bought a pair to complement Atrium 55 speakers in my home gym.  These speakers sound great!  Well worth the extra money!,0
Great product. I also own the RM 705 sat. speakers and they sound great as well. You can not go wrong with POLK. Quality and reasonable.I purchased the monitor 50's ,0
I ride the subway in NYC and since purchases these headphones,0
This earphone has been designed to make the listener provide ease of use and great sound quality and a brilliantly built.,0
This is my second purchase for a new house being built. I get to create an additional sound room and bought new equipment for it. This subwoofer was a must have and I recommend it to everyone while it's still available.,0
Only had for a few weeks now but so far I am very pleased with the sound of the speaker. Charge seems to last a long time. Bluetooth range is excellent.,0
Its a great product. The quality is great. I love the sound of it. Ive had a flip 2 and it was good and when something went wrong they fixed it.,0
Great value for money,0
I have to say that I was unexpectedly impressed and was skeptical at first.  Very compact,0
I was looking for a portable bluetooth speaker that I could travel with and I found it in the Flip. Bigger sound than some of the smaller units,0
I bought these speakers new back in 1998. They still rock the house. They are also subtle and refined.  I have thoroughly enjoyed my babies for 15 years now and don't plan on replacing them anytime soon,0
I brought this like 1week ago.. it's really comfortable to use but the buds are big in size... Try make it into 3sets.,0
Pleasantly surprised by these headphones. I was given them as a gift by a friend. Bluetooth works perfectly too (as opposed to many headphones that don't automatically connect and give connection problems in general). Also,0
The quality of the product and sound quality is incredible for the price. The technology adapts perfectly to my latest Yamaha AV receiver.,0
It begins sound comes and goes to the point it's not usable--after about 20 feet from the desktop there is no mobile phone here.  What is recommended as a range extender for the Charge 2+ ?,0
Perfect if you need to relax in the evening while listening to it with a really clear and natural sound and of course the light show is exceptional with vibrant  and bright LEDs.,0
KNOWN FOR THEIR BASS,0
My wife bought me this speaker as an anniversary present and I have to admit that it is simple to operate and reproduces the most amazing sound quality for such a small unit. I have owned other bluetooth speakers but they don't even come close. Well done BOSE.,0
These things are great!!! I purchased an entire lifestyle 3500 system from Bose and I am not kidding when I say these speakers alone are much more satisfying to listen to than that entire system.,0
Hi the speaker is great but as soon as I try to call WhatsApp contact using the revolve speaker the call gets disconnected. Additionally if my speakers are paired imo calls get rejected. Can you please look into it?,0
I bought this with the sole purpose of bringing back my old Bose Lifestyle 28 entertainment system,0
A lot more bass and volume in general than you'd expect. Also,0
Love both the speakers I purchased,0
Overall this a great speaker. It has a solid build and great loud and clear sound with easy to use functions but the Bluetooth needs improvement. But overall great stuff,0
I love this product and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for this type of carrying case. Is definitely the best available on the market. Great price for value as well.,0
This product brings home entertainment to life without the need for speakers dotted all around your room and enables you you to play music direct from TV tablet or phone. A little complicated to set up but I'm not techi and the Bose support team soon had me up and running.,0
I bought this syatem on 22 oct from online partners amazon india. However the system was delivered without remote . and am getting a feelong of being harrassed by theeir customer service,0
The small cover over the charging port needs to have a stronger connection one that doesn't break off. The sound is incredible even at the lowest setting. Almost prefect!,0
IT IS VERY GOOD DESIGNED COMPACT SOUND SYSTEM,0
I pre-ordered the Galaxy Note 9,0
I got it from a friend,0
Had my Soundlink for a week now and played it constantly.  Love the speaker phone feature for calls.,0
sound is very clear,0
Bought this for when we have bbq or fire pit parties outside this coming year. My husband and kids swiped it after it arrived and made it the tv speaker. They loke it way better for both shows and video games than the sound bar i had there. So i will be getting another one for outside it seems haha!,0
i forgot to tell that there is also a momo 8 inch running in the back smooth and direct ! i want to replace the original speakers in the back door for a 13 cm mid speaker from polk also db series greetings from holland!,0
Loving the ‘versatility’ of this small speaker! Take it to the pool,0
great device for parents to have,0
JBL has been improving their products every year. I have owned a number of JBL products the past couple of years and they get better every year. The new JBL Everest line is worth purchasing. You will not be disappointed.,0
I bought this for my college dorm and just tested it out today. It was easy to set up and has great sound quality.,0
Very good performance even at high volume. Battery last enough time. Never got disappointed. Worth for the price.,0
Love the speaker but very disappointed that it did not come with its own charger. And the charger from my charge3 would not fully charge the 4. Had to buy my own charger.,0
I bought this on 2016 Black Friday deal and its worth for the Value of Money spent on it.Its curve design fits into the ear properly. But sound quality can be improved,0
Your Bose 535 is the perfect system. Great Sound for music,0
I already enjoy the sound and convenience of the Flip 4.The Charge 3 sounds great as well although a bit different.Classcal and jazz sound really well with this speaker.The only drawback is the sound when turning the speakers on and off.,0
> Best Speaker with desired functionality. > Good enough for rooms like bedrooms or personal workspace. > Audio is very stable no distortion noticed on high volumes. > Internet radio is the best part. > Met all expectations except the display could have been dim-able.,0
Paid 10.99...I use them for running and at the gym ...perfect ...the cord very good quality ..the sound a 7 out of 10,0
I have used a lot of different brands,0
I believe it's the best soundbar right now anyone can buy! Soundbar alone is more than capable of giving you best sound experience but can't wait to get my hands on to the complete system..,0
DUH!!! It's a Bose. I got what was expected and am completely satisfied. Another in a line of Bose products that I own. Why waste the time and effort it takes to try a so-called equivalent?,0
I have an alpine head unit,0
I've had this michrophone for over ten years and it's in great shape and sounds great - still. Hope I can buy another in Canada when I need to.,0
My JBL Flip never ceases to amaze me every time I fire it up. For a device so compact it has a mighty sound so much greater than you'd expect. How could you be dissapointed?,0
Awesome sound quality,0
Very impressive.  Excellent detail and surprising imaging.  Low frequencies are superb for such a compact sub.  Remote could be better and bigger.  Touch controls on front are very cool.,0
Bluetooth works seamlessly,0
It is full of bass! Every song is added with bass,0
I'm very picky and these rock. Awesome sound beyond Beats and jambra and Apple is a joke Fit? A++ perfect in my ear. Apple D--,0
I’ve had these for a week now and I’ve just got to say that Bose has done a pretty decent job on them . I’ve used them on my holiday and this served me quite well . The noise cancelling on these is almost perfect. As for the durability last week I banged my head onto this and nothing happened to it,0
Somehow my brother is on my speker trolling me sometimes. Is there a way i can unpair his device? And this should be added in the app!,0
Really lack in volume . Through any of my I devices this set of headphones ,0
I've been using these headphones for 2 months now. I really like them. They fit around my big head properly and are a lot comfier than my previous pair. The wireless is great,0
they sound great and they stay in place even while exercising. on several occasions,0
Polk has a great reputation for audio products. Installation was a snap on my 2000 Isuzu Rodeo. Would recommend to anyone.,0
I really love this speaker! It's sound is great,0
I have a set of Polk spwakers for my 7.1 system,0
Headphones exceeded expectations in all ways,0
I bought 2 weeks ago the JBL Flip 3 black. The main reason was to work wireless with my Dell 9950 laptop. Unfortunately even after updating the software to the current one,0
Great set of speakers. Dont be fooled by the size. Very powerful and crisp sound. Paired up with a psw12 and sounds Great! You wont be dissapointed,0
Currently using these for my 1969 pioneer sx-990 with huge amounts of bass ,0
I replaced my 10inch alpine type R's with these because i traded in my stang for an suv and I could not be happier.  The bass is just sick.,0
3 rd pair on there way,0
"This speaker doesnt have all the bells and whistles like a creepy ""Low Battery"" voice and wont dive for oysters. But it does have a very surprisingly big sound for a smallish speaker. Way happy with this speaker. I ended up buying two more and giving them as Christmas presents.",0
Bought this product together with my soundsport pulse,0
I bought 3 pairs for multi room home setup. These are pretty good at low volume background music and loud enough for party music,0
Bought this around two weeks ago and I am more than happy! Very good sound for being so small and easy to carry.,0
I bought these speakers a couple months ago. I knew of JBL's reputation however I never thought I would get such quality at such a low price. I've been telling everyone about the deal I got by buying direct,0
These Things are awesome.  Much Better Than Mr. Ross's G@y Bose speaker set up.  They sound better than my old Polk RT1000i's,0
Awesome sound package! It was a little pricey,0
First time with Bose and all I can say is wow. I’ve never heard “The Long Black Train” this good.  I think when I recover from buying soundbar I’ll add the Acoustimass 300.,0
I have only had my Bluetooth speaker for less than 7 months and it is not turning on or charging. :(  Not sure if this problem is the cord or the speaker itself? Please help,0
Bought these speakers as gifts for other people and they tell me that they love their new speakers. A very good Bluetooth speaker for someone who needs to upgrade from their built in speaker in their phone. The sound is rich with sinewave bass motion. Quite comforting.,0
I bought my first set of AM-5's back in 92.  They sounded great,0
Product is phenomenal! Crisp,0
So far I brought this item & it's been treating me well . I hope one of the ears don't stop working again . This is my second pair of headphones from jbl,0
Absolutely amazing headphones!! Would 100% recommend to anyone who wants to get a high end pair because they are a little pricey but completely worth it!! I had the over ear Bose headphones that didn't have noise cancelling and the QC25 headphones are light years better!!,0
While traveling home for holidays this particular clock was in my hotel. The sound was amazing. My daughter noticed how much I liked it. Gifted it to me for Christmas. I absolutely Love it!,0
Nice speaker.  Well made and crystal clear.  I used bass blockers which I'd recommend. Installed in a 91 Sonoma and had trouble fitting in the front due to the dept.  Just modified the grille mounts to get a little extra room and squeezed them in.,0
I have the Bose Companion 2 or 3.. can't remember,0
I had both the QC25 and SoundLink AE2 headphones for different purposes.  I used the QC25's for travel and the AE2 for listening to music around the house.  The QC35's combine the best of both worlds.  I am now able to use the QC35's for travel and my wireless streaming with my Apple devices.,0
I upgraded after selling the previous version. I am truly delighted. The Soundtouch is impressive and easy to use. I have since bought two more for different rooms.,0
So happy I purchased this product! The sound quality is great,0
A pair of this microphone delivers the spatial perspective that I want and still place them in an unobtrusive manner. What is surprising is the fact that the more cost effective AT2021 has a brigther sound,0
I'm amazed at the volume,0
I'm very happy with the purchase of the Polk XM tuner.  It fits in with my other components and I'm very satisfied with the sound quality and button controls.  I highly recommend it.,0
The speakers are absolutly amazing,0
I put the case though some challenges already. The fabric is great as is the durability. The only way to make it better would have been to include a one inch slot to put the charger.,0
I just bought these used. These sound stellar as a book-shelf or surround speaker. Have the classic Polk sound. I own the SDA-2's (Nothing compares to the SDA's)and am looking to upgrade to the SDA-1's. Great Job Polk!!,0
Excellent sound quality and priced well ,0
I am experiencing amazing sound quality when listening to music or watching streaming videos via Netflix. My only feedback is for the charging unit to have more chord length between unit and headphone jack. Keep up the great work Bose!,0
This speaker was sent to my family as part of the Backstage Pass program and we love it! The built in Google home is so nice and convenient. We have it set up in the kitchen and it’s so convenient for us. The volume is amazing and the setup was very easy. Love it!,0
Not much highs. It's more geared for teenagers.  I think they need to put some more mids and highs with it,0
I bought it some weeks ago and I really love the sound it gives. Chose the red one and it is beautiful. Love everything about it.,0
I bought this as a Christmas gift for my nephew and he absolutely loves it. This is he first JBL and he can’t stop talking about how loud and clear the music is. Definitely worth the purchase,0
I love the JBL Flip 4. It’s so compact yet it is also loud with a solid beat. I got it only 2 weeks ago but I’m so excited to take it with me to the mountains in the summer!,0
I bought this speaker a few months ago and I love it! It's very loud and the battery actually last long compared to other speakers. Great for parties. Quality is top notch,0
I bought two pairs of these to replace factory installed speakers in a boat,0
These are amazing! The sound quality is great,0
I bought this item and really good! I am fully satisfied with the sound and bass,0
My partner almost permanently wears headphones and was really impressed with how they are attached,0
Great speaker for the price,0
I bought this for myself to have at work. It really sounds extremely nice. For the size of the JBL  Go,0
These Bose Virtually Invisible 300 wireless surround speakers are amazing... I bought it for my SoundTouch 300 soundbar and I was amazed by the full surround sound and the sound quality. Its a great combination.,0
Amazing sound and battery life! only issue i have is connecting a third speaker through jbl connect. Once that's resolved I will change my rating to 5 stars!,0
"I've had mine for 3 years now = LOVE IT!!! Had it cranked to max (for a test a few times) with NO distortion! Stand away from the unit and be amazed with the life-like band in house clarity etc. + The low end produced via the ""Wave"" tech. is quite impressive.",0
Impressive sound. The cables are flat,0
I use it fo ray MacBook Pro and my iPhone 6s,0
Excellent sound and visual display! I bought 2 and linked them to my jbl boombox for the ultimate sound experience.,0
i bout a jbl on beat micro with the christmas money i have and i love it. it sounds good and the desighn is awesome and never will go to bose or beats or anything....,0
Amazing Sound for a speaker this size,0
I need help because I can not to use my JBL for calls. I can hear people but they do not listen to me ... What should I do?,0
Can’t beat the set up and the sound quality for the price   2 flip4s cost less than $110 and when paired together using  the connect app you have great stereo sound from these 2 little speakers.,0
Its really an awesome product. Even in low volume,0
The Bose Solo 15 is best suited for those don't need an bass module with a home theater system. The bass control is very good addition,0
I am blown away by the sound quality these headphones produce,0
This is perfect from streaming music from my ipad and/or phone.  Nice deep sound and volume control.  Would definitely recommend.,0
When I take this speaker home,0
Owned these little beuts for over five months now and they are amazing the only con is when you turn your head. To the left it cuts off the left headphone but if your jogging can become a plus when running a cross the road to hear and see traffic.,0
Just took it out of the box today. Got it paired easily. Washed the car with it on in the garage.  Excellent sound,0
Wow its small but the sound that comes out of it is very BIG indeed fantastic product the sound quality is amazing for its size. every one should have one these.,0
since i was very young JBL has always been my favorite and again they have stepped up to the plate to knock one out of the park. my extreme is perfect,0
I got these for Christmas and i wanted them so bad I love them but they don't stay connected to my Chromebook but I guess that's why they come with a cord I got them in black,0
YESSSSSS!!!!!! now i have another  POLK SRT SYSTEM (my second one!!) and make a QUAD ARRAY SYSTEM with 4 gigantic Subwoofers!!!!now every Movie is a FEELING ...NO CINEMA in Europe has a sound like This!!!It`s the ultimate Soundsystem ever!!!!another Thanx to M.POLK for this System!!!!!,0
Awesome!!!! Just got it. I use it in a variety of settings. Bose is the best,0
I bought these headphones last Saturday and I absolutely love them. You don't realize how much noise there is until you put these headphones on,0
I was shocked with the sound that comes from such a little speaker.Room filling.Just absolutely crazy.Would totally recommend this.It's a awesome and quality product for the money,0
I no longer have to have my amp on 6 channel stereo to rock my livingroom.  I listen to every thing from classical to heavy metal and it all sounds great.  Bravo,0
I was thinking of getting the  Bose SLM 2 but bought this instead. Best choice I ever made! Good bass and crisp sound. Waterproof and nice looking speakers.,0
This product had been recommended to me and they were not wrong,0
Just got these about a week ago,0
I finally organized my garage and I placed 2 pairs of ATRIUM 45's,0
the sound that this bar is making is just amazing,0
They are nicely designed,0
Great speaker,0
I bought this for a birthday present for my partner. He loved it! So great sound for such a small size! You can take it anywhere. Very pleased!,0
This is the best sound system I have ever had. Better than Bose. However,0
If you pair these with a quality amp and a good sub,0
This tiny palm size box is 100% perfect just as all other Bose speakers only bad part is that Bose should have included a travel pouch,0
After doing a ton of research and listening to many different speakers,0
The QC20i's are phenomenal! I'm a first-time Bose customer. Price has usually kept me away,0
I got these headphones like 6 years ago,0
I've ran a lot of different types of sound systems in vehicles and nothing performs like these components. Time and time again when people ask for my recommendations I refer them to these speakers when used with an amp. And to boot these are certified for Marine too.,0
They offer crystal clear sound particularly at the high range. It means you can hear throbbing bass in trance music. best value for your $$$,0
I've recently changed form beats that I had for many years and have been really happy with my Bose and wouldn't change back,0
I like my JBL GO.  I would rate it 5 stars if I understood more about how it works.  It came with no instructions.  I would love to be able to hear music from my phone and the box at the same time. Then two locations could listen to the music.,0
they sound really good and very clean! theyre not the loudest subs ever but im pretty satisfied with them for 200$ brand new off a friend!!,0
These are probably the most comfortable sport headphones I’ve had. The ear clip is quite flexible and so doesn’t pinch behind the ears. I’ve got small ears so really glad it had 3 different ear pieces.,0
Bought as a gift for my son and he loves the sound quality. Sorry no photos as he lives out of state.,0
Just got my JBL Horizon radio in white. Love the rich sound and ease of use. Looks great with the decor!,0
Deep,0
They sound very good crisp clean and clear I would have liked to hear some more rich deep bass the k77 that I have are louder at the same level but every head phones are different I do love my new k240 thank you AKG,0
I bought this for Christmas,0
Spend a few extra dollars on this amazing piece of equipment. its well worth it. I got a color link,0
Wow! These sleepbuds are a nice sleep aid for me.  I've suffered from insomnia for 15 years and these do make quite a difference in my ability to sleep.  I've used prescription meds in the past and I will never use them again due to their side effects.,0
I bought the QC 35 II five days ago and so far I can say that the experience I had is quite impressive. I am using the QC during the day during the work time and I really can stay concentrate while I am on the computer. The QC really isolate me from the outside world.,0
At first i bougth these speaker for surround dutties hopping to buy floorstanders in future. Gues wat ? I never looked bc i just purchace two subs. These bookshelf are the best thing ul ever need,0
I bought these 2 weeks ago and I absolutely LOVE them. They are extremely comfortable and never fall out. Also the replacements make for a perfect fit. Recommend them to anyone who wants durable wireless earbuds,0
I was amazed bat the difference between playing music from my phone and my Bose speaker. It's so clear and sounds like a suround sound. Easy to use,0
Bought these a couple of months back and have not been disappointed despite my initial concern about the quite substantial outlay. They are paying me back every day on my commute to work! Ace!,0
I have had my Flip 4 for about a Month. I love it! Music sounds very very good through these speakers.,0
when connected to bluetooth using my Lenovo laptop volume is very low even i max out the volume.tried every possible solutions online but to no avail....,0
These speakers are not for the faint of heart. If you want something that has kick these babies more than meat the criteria!,0
Easy pairing method with my NFC. The clarity of music is perfect,0
I have brought this spaker one day ago. first i think it is small volume will be less but when i played first time it was amazing,0
Great sounding speakers but I would echo both reviews already posted and say they're not loud enough unless listening to 5:1. Transformers are twice the size of the speakers themselves so have unsightly wire all over the place. Update required in my opinion!,0
Got these while they were at a steal of a price of $12.99. Definitely worth it. Great sound quality,0
Bose came out with many new systems. I bought first for in my living room but was do happy with the sound that I wanted also 1 in my office. The bose soundtouch is the perfect size,0
Bought speaker recently. Good sound which is improved by using an equaliser. App that supports the speaker could be better.,0
After 14 years of fine listening to my SDA-1C's I still use them as a reference to others. I've never had a problem with them. They still put a smile on my face when I listen to them. In one word. AWESOME. Even after 14 years.,0
Bought a couple of months ago to use in the hotel whilst working away but now gets used everywhere- good battery life,0
Great for the hammock,0
I brought this during offer which was $14,0
I would like to now if the little cover for the headphones how can I buy more of the covers cuz I lose mine all athe time???,0
Simply amazing Polk doesn't disappoint with this sub plenty of power for movies and music the setup was easy with the directions given best sub for price point,0
at the ease of installation,0
i bought this a few days ago,0
I tried them on instantly fell in love  Type of work I do these frames are perfect rich sound nothing in my ear or on top of my head. I love them,0
My girlfriend got me the mini 2 for Christmas and I love it! Great clarity in such a small speaker. The ability to move it from room to room and not have to worry with wires is great. Very pleased with this product.,0
I did a lot of research before buying a new pair of speakers.  I had been using a pair of DCM TF-700 speakers,0
I am a little disappointed in the volume that can be attained but I am likely slightly deaf from some of the larger speakers JBL has produced.,0
I never thought such a small monster could do magic! Its exceeds your expectations and very nice colors too,0
My wife wanted headphones when travelling overseas and these were recommended. No going back to any cheaper headphones. Just love them,0
I bought my sound bar over a year ago was very easy to set up right out of the box sounds great and still planning adding  the bass portion of it when I get the funds. Only problem I have is these funny looking head set don't know or where it go the reason for the 4 star instead of 5.,0
Perfect for use in the kitchen with a Chromebook. Plays most of a day on one charge,0
I got my glasses oh I love it 100% only comment I have is I wish the lens is the transitional lens so that when your inside or when it's not sunny you can still keep it on ok Bose time to update the lens otherwise love love love it,0
For the price,0
The JBL Xtreme has top sound quality,0
Use these in the gym 3-5 days per week,0
These are without doubt the best speakers I've ever owned. The sound is so clean,0
I liked this product got it for a better price. The sound clarity is so Great and I would love to recommend this product to others. Excellent and Quality product.,0
Without ear phones due to a short I opened the package and AWESOME! I forget I have em in my ears! HiFi music! WOW!...,0
I have a couple of headphones and these are amazing! I have Sol Republics and Bose head gear and they are great. However,0
I got this from Marshells not expecting anything life changing or amazing since it was cheap price. But the sound quality is super clear! Loud enough to play at the pool or beach and be heard over wind and other people around us. Love it!,0
I liked this speaker so much I bought a second one so I have one for work and one for home. The one I use at home is mainly for the yard grilling and  enjoying a cigar and yard work. I also have JBL headphones when mowing the lawn witch sould great also but are not very loud.,0
I get pair of SRX 835p on summer 2015 & sound awesome I love it...I plan to get another pair Next Summer I recommended.,0
Used it on the plane when I slept. Worked extremely well. The whole world become quiet. But I could still hear the high voice,0
I use this mostly for Audiobooks. Also waiting at appointments. I can listen while my husband listens to his music.  And the Clarity for me is great.. I also like to listen to Audiobooks at night in Bed. Very comfortable lying down and does not disturb my Husband.,0
This has got to be the best speaker I've bought. The sound quality is enormous when you crank it up. Everyone I've shown it to wants to buy one.,0
Got this as a Christmas gift....took longer to pull out of the box than to set up.   Sound is near movie theater quality.,0
I'd like to make a suggestion for an accessory some kind of floating dock or something like that I take it in the pool all the time but have to hold it . Something I could put it in so it will float around the pool would be nice.,0
These are by far the best headphones I have ever owned. I'm very very pleased with the build quality and the sound quality is outstanding,0
Great speaker,0
Bought my Sound Link speaker earlier today,0
I suggest that the guy who gave a negative review change amps or something because this is the best bang for the buck out there.I am glad I let the sales guy talk me into buying it,0
I really enjoy my Bose speaker but there are times it won't even turn on. I can't figure out the issue. Even my software is up to date :-/,0
Just received my buds! So excited. I’ve had several Bose products for years and see no reason to change. Thanks Bose!,0
everything is fine with it,0
I'm running 2 of these off of a MTX 801D and the sound reproduction is perfect,0
This speaker has great range,0
"Got the earbuds...thinking that they sound ""Tinney"" Imagine my surprise when I placed in my ears! What I received was ""FULL RANGE"" and INTEGRATED!",0
Had these as a Christmas present. Best headphones ever. Comfortable to wear,0
Was very easy to install. Upgraded from the 3-2-1 and can't believe the difference. Highly recommend this system.,0
One of the most beautiful qualities of Music System,0
Sound and comfort are unbeatable.I have owned the headphones for quite a while now and they are superior to others I have tried.,0
For the price,0
Just got mine yesterday and I'm loving them! I thought my hubby was tricking me by just moving his lips but not speaking. Elton John was drowning him out! Best present I've gotten myself in a long time.,0

It's compact,0
Wonderful,0
Bought this for my sister. She loves the color (pink). Good sound for such a little thing. Very portable.,0
One of my best friend gave me a Sound Link For my 65thbirthday,0
Light weight,0
The pluses:-  Great sound. Portable. Durable. Value for money. Does what it says.  Minus:- It cannot be past the innovative Bose engineers to install a switch to switch between bluetooth and wi-fi. We could then listen locally eg by the pool  or listen in the garden via wi-fi.,0
After listening to XM Radio for over a year,0
Uncanny how this speaker can produce such fine and loud sound. The quality and finish are top notch as well.,0
I purchased these earphones to use when I exercise.  They work very well.  They stay in the ear while I exercise,0
We purchased our sound system a couple of weeks ago and love it. Still getting use to the music streaming and using our I TUNES account. One quesiton is there a chance in the future we can stream music from Sirius XM and Amazon.,0
I just bought this product and it sounds like the artist is in your living room . I'am using primarily Bluetooth and what a difference with Signal Doctor it makes my Itunes collection come to life. Also the speaker looks very classy with the walnut finish.,0
"i had 2 audiobahn aw152n = 15"" 650 rmsW each",0
I bought my first pair when they first came out. Love them. Have never been a fan of headphones/earphones but this product is fantastic.,0
I bought this for my Bose Sound Link to store it in to keep it from getting scratched etc.... Once I put it on (has a snug fit,0
I bought this around two months ago and these headphones are amazing I   wanted to check out the noise cancling so i went to my computer played music at max volume put on noise cancling and could not hear a thing bought on eBay new for 280,0
Sync with my s8 with no problem. Run several miles every other day and they do not fall out or get uncomfortable. Sound is great.,0
Exceptional sound quality that I have come to expect from Bose products.  I am so pleased with this speaker.  Cant recommend this enough.,0
The best money i have ever spent. It was the first system i bought and i'm pushin it with a 750 watt kicker amp. It straight drills. I have a 1998 blazer and i can bounce a full 20 liter coke bottle a couple of inches of the top of my car.,0
Actually,0
Absolutely love this speaker,0
Its a grt product ,0
Very good sounding speaker,0
I love the style,0
absolutely love it never write reviews but I have a few bose items never go wrong with their sound or quality. .battery doesn't quite as long as stated only minutes gripe otherwise it would be a 6 star,0
these headphones are very high tech,0
the best speaker that i ever heard in my life.it sounds better than most pioneers in its class.idid not think ia 400watt speaker could actually take 1000watts of raw power.it is an EXCELLENT speaker.,0
Best friend in travel - need one enhancement which is know the battery status from the iPhone or from the headset,0
Just setup my new SoundTouch 10 system today. Very easy setup. Great sounding speakers as I have come to expect from Bose. So far only using it with Pandora,0
Love it and very simple for traveling. Noise Canceling was working properly nice in my ear.. Bose simple the best for me. Thanks,0
I was going to buy the JBL Pulse but,0
I bought these a couple of weeks ago and the noise cancellation on this thing is CARZY!! I’m super happy I bought these they are great for working out! All in all 9 out of 10.,0
Just got my new Soundtrue headphones. I have been putting them through their paces with different genres of music. Not only are they the most comfortable headphones I have ever owned but they are smooth as silk. I am very glad I purchased these and I highly recommend them.,0
The last pair of running earbuds I had finally died and their brand was discontinued. No other pairs have lived up until I found this one. I've had them for over a month and I LOVE THEM. They don't fall out,0
Very good signal - walked around the house including a second floor: works everywhere! Little bit too tight,0
I brought this a month ago and it sounds great.firmware get updated itself so now i can use party mode.loved this feature.,0
Enamus katsetatud supparitest parem,0
You can't beat the price! I bought this speaker about a month ago and this sound is amazing,0
JBL Charge 2+ not only delivers the great bass and loudness I was looking for,0
I bought this speaker off of Good Morning America's deals and steals,0
This product performs as I had hoped. I like the waterproof feature. My old JBL Charge however,0
I wish it had more control like rewind and fast-forward and an auxiliary input wouldn't be bad but other than that I love it,0
I have had this almost 1 year. I am now thinking of putting a gain knob on it so I can adjust on the go. It does not appear I can though. Is there any port for a jbl specific controller?,0
Quality to price is unbeatable. Would love more wireless controls for skipping tracks and a travel case. Other than that... Better than my Beats Solos.,0
I've always known Bose is the best for sound but this is my 1rst Bose sound output. I did have to call for help once but otherwise i was able to figure it out myself. I absolutely love my Bose Soundbar 300. I did get the Bass Module and 2 rear speakers as well.,0
Bought these 2 weeks ago and happy I did. Great deep sounds and the bt works for a pretty good distance.,0
Great sounding speakers.  These Atrium45 speakers sound terrific and look great.  They really do outperform the Bose outdoor speakers which cost twice as much.  I would not usually write a review like this,0
I'm owning Bose headphones for The Last 5 Years and now again with this qc35 version 2 Bose did a great job very comfortable headphones and very amazing sound,0
It has amazing sound in a small package. It is easy for travel,0
The sound from my new Rumble is really surprising. I had a feeling when I ordered it that it would be pretty good just because of the JBL name,0
These are very good speakers very crisp and handle power well I read keep reading reviews about distortion and people need to know speakers don't distort Amps do. If your having distortion with these speakers you need a better amp.,0
The ATM650 is my favorite for close mic-ing guitar cabs,0
After failing to find an alternate stand that would fit,0
As one of my Christmas presents I was given this speaker and and out of the box,0
I bought this a month ago and it works amazing the best speaker in the market I would say. It is worth every single penny. I wouldn’t recommend connecting two devices at the same time to the speaker it creates a little lagging,0
how do you know? the damn thing aint even on the market. please do not pay attenuation to my rating or language,0
Thse sound fantastic at the price point. We've had nothing but happy clients when we have installed systems with these speakers.,0
It took Harman three weeks to ship this speaker once ordered.  Great speaker but terrible supply line ops!  If you try to track your order,0
I had the soundlink color and just upgraded to the revolve. The sound quality is absolutely amazing. Bose quality is unbeatable.,0
For the money very good sounding speaker I listen to these in a 2channel setup very musical and the voice quality is neutral equipment carver preamp,0
Didn't think i would like these round my ears but they are so comfy you forget about them. They don't fall out like the others i have and have been very pleasantly surprised. Perfect for the treadmill.,0
I bought it a month ago with a good deal $17.99.  It's performance and features are beyond my expectation.  I highly recommend it.,0
"DAXQg4  <a href=""http://xmfqhwztzktt.com/"">xmfqhwztzktt</a>",0
I bought my Bose n due to constant use,0
I have been a fan of JBL speakers for almost 30 years. JBL quality and sound is what all others should be judged by. Every JBL product that I have been great sounding. The JBL go is no exception. It has GREAT SOUND for such a small package.,0
I just like JBL's combination of bass,0
i have been using this for a couple of weeks now. I find the product very easy to use,0
Just using it for a radio in my garage running 2 small Advent speakers Sounds good plenty of power.,0
I purchaced this product from Radio shack last Saturday april 12th. It was a toss up between this product and another product,0
i bought it for travelling because the headset is so easy to pack and its comfortable. Also its a good headphones under $100 with a top class sound.,0
I bought five pairs pairs of these for fifty dollars. Got them on sale and it was totally worth it absolutely amazing deal great quality headphones for a great quality price.,0
Bought them a year ago or more when they first released. All the bugs have been worked out. Sound is amazing! Always was! BOSE sound is the best sound.,0
Finally moved up to Bose after three other purchases of NC headphones over the years. Best sound and comfort by far!  Wireless/Bluetooth works well. Watch out for the charging cord...it is really short and may not be practical for some users (like me). Can Bose make that cord a little longer?,0
I bought this one week ago,0
I put these in as replacements for my wife's 2002 Saturn SL2 OEM speakers.  The difference was like night and day.  The sound actually fills the car now with great clarity and presence.   It was such an improvement my daughter had them installed in her 1999 Saturn.   Polk got it right with these!,0
I got this as a gift,0
I love this little speaker! It has plenty of volume and I am amazed at how long the charge holds up. Works so much better than any I have tried before.,0
I bought the about a month ago and I am very happy with them.  The sound is so much better than my old headphones.,0
Pros: Good sound Lightweight Cost effective The lack of noise cancellation makes it good for running  Cons: No volume control Uncomfortable if you wearing them for a long time,0
got this package bundle today and i'm really over the moon i got it cheaper at my bose local store.highly recommended best sound quality etc! really worth the price.weeeee,0
This is a great product,0
This is easy to use and works great. Like that I can hear it over the radio playing. Nice that I can take it from car to car.,0
I generally stayed away from this style of headphones because I could never get them to stay in my ears but the twist feature really keeps them in place and the sound was a nice surprise too. Couldn't beat the price. I ordered several more pair and would recommend them.,0
I’ve noticed a little of of connectivity issues with the studio as it will cut on when their is very low noise on the tv. Beyond that this sound bar was totally worth the price,0
Pros - durable,0
Great speaker,0
just upgraded from dxi460 I enjoyed the so much I just had to purchase these I KNOW that I will get my money out of these,0
These earbuds have amazing sound! I love their durable build,0
I bought a pair of these a month ago and I found these to be very good in sound quality and features for the price. It occasionally drops the signal from my phone,0
Attached to Samsung TV with optical connection,0
I also own an Onyx  two but if you are looking for a more powerful output give this a try it's worth it. I wish HK would offer a hub like device MIDI  that will let you connect your speaker and play stereo.,0
I have had mine for about a week and it is fantastic.  I wish I had bought two of them.  The sound quality is absolutely great.  It works great on my boat.,0
This is the best sound bar you will ever own! Super easy to set up and the sound is super crisp. The remote control is easy to get used to. I run Direct tv,0
Best value for money in the price range compared to other BT speakers. It is able to distill different sounds well at max volume.,0
An excellent looking and sounding speaker. It is very large and was obviously meant for bigger rooms. The sound is clearer and more defined than all of my local cinemas. You will not go wrong nuying these as they are the cream of the crop in mid to entry level Polks!,0
Have had these headphones for 6 months now and they are great! Perfect,0
Very nice looking speaker for my boats tower encloser.  The sound great with no sound quality issues untill I run out of amp.  I would highly recommend to anyone wanting to impress.,0
I was looking for a pair of decent IEMs that I can leave at the office for listening while I work and these were a good choice for that.  These sound a little warmer than my higher end headphones but the sound is very good for the price.  They're comfortable and fit snuggly for good isolation.,0
The QC25 is an excellent headphone for anyone looking for a noise cancellation headphones. I was not looking for a noise cancellation but having it was an added advantage. The sound quality is AWESOME!!! No doubt..  I have it for more than a month now and till now there is no issues.,0
I bought this a month back and using it regularly,0
Got this for Christmas this year! I'm so impressed with it. The speaker looks good! It was so simple to connect to my phone. The sound is amazing,0

I bought the SurroundBar 2/14/07 I've watched about a dozen movies,0
I bought this for my 2006 tundra limited because it has limited space for a sub. The subwoofer makes an insane amount of bass for its tiny size. Highly recommend,0
I have these speakers and they are incredible!  Then you look at the price tag and they are even better!,0
I recently purchased the sound touch 300 complete system (subwoofer,0
Fantastic works for exactly what I needed it for - speaker for the bathroom.  Wanted something to listen to audiobooks while in the bathtub.  It is perfect.,0
I got this for Christmas! Excellent present due to the fact the sound from this small,0
Purchased these headphones after being recommended by a friend. Purchased them just before I boarded a flight and charged them from the USB socket on the plane. Couldn't believe how well the noise cancelling worked and the fantastic quality of the sound. Thoroughly recommend. Well worth the cost.,0
I got the Bose Solo for Christmas from my wife it simply gives the best sound we have ever heard from a television (we have had 4 sound systems on different TV,0
Had these for almost a year,0
My son into nieces receive these in their stockings for Christmas and couldn't be happier ! It's been enjoyed while with us on long car rides,0
This is one of the best speaker (RM6200) and subwoofer (PSW250) combinations in this price range. The combination with the Onkyo Receiver 595 gives amazing sound from a number of sources including DVD. The sound is not shrill and bass can be adjusted as per the listener's liking.,0
Sound quality and comfort are best in class. Go to a bose store to test before buying,0
I hate anything on or in my ears hence the SoundWear Companion speaker is ideal for me and the sound quality is astounding.,0
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS LITTLE BOX SOUNDS SO LOUD.  I GOT IT ON SALE BUT I WOULD BUY ANOTHER AT THE REGULAR PRICE.  IT'S SO WORTH IT.,0
Was looking for a great set of wireless headphones.  Knowing JBL is a great product without the high ticket price,0
Definitely worth the price. It's really light in weight. The sound is good for its price. It's slightly uncomfortable in the ears when you use it too long (or I'm just really not used to wearing headphones).,0
I have had Bose 901s since 1988,0
Although I understand they don't make this item any longer,0
Not only do they stay in place like glue,0
Bought as a gift to warm my daughter's office with background music.  Great price,0
I paired the Bass Module 700 with the Soundbar 700. I have been using for about two weeks now. I really enjoy the strong Bass of movies and music. With wireless connectivitly,0
I've used many speakers at the beach but this one is the clear best. The battery life,0
I listened to many mini-towers and found these speakers to be an outstanding value. After pairing with the CSi40 & PSW650,0
When I out USB charger in the red light come on then it goes straight off with in a few seconds been this way for two days still no charge,0
I have been using Pro 3 for almost 30 years. I am so happy to get same spec. replacement with more crispy sound.,0

This speaker has amazing sound the clarity is awesome the price was a little steep but it was well worth it and I just bought it a month ago amazing product,0
I've had the jbl go for about three weeks now and it is more than what I hoped for. It sounds really good for a little speaker. Thanks JBL for the fast shipping and good prices,0
I bought this two years ago and have used it everyday when watching ,0
This was the easiest set up ever. Then the sound that came from the bar and the sub was just AWESOME! I'm really happy with this purchase and so will you.,0
Man,0
I was looking at the infinitys,0
I bought this last week and very satisfied with the purchase. Great sound quality,0
They should cost a lot more,0
Sound is the best from these types of headphones,0
This thing packs a punch! I got one for myself and my boyfriend and we both love this little speaker so much. My boyfriend says he uses his for a few hours everyday and holds its charge well. The sound is so loud and clear and I got 2 on sale so I couldn't be happier!,0
I really like these. For the money they produce astounding sound. They will never compare to my Beyerdynamic or Sennheiser corded headphones but that's like comparing,0
I received as a gift.    Firs well.  occasionally doesnt seat correctly for recharging.   I wish there were options for sounds,0
First impressions are very favourable. Received 2 weeks ago to review,0
Awesome product,0
Like the tittle says they're awesome,0
Got this as a gift for my Birthday & I absolutely love it. So for Christmas I bought two of them as gifts & they r also excited about the item. Great product for its price.,0
It sounds great. It light and comfortable. It really cancels out the outside noise. Love that it is wireless and weightless.,0
K518 DJ HeadPhone is very good in quality and i suggest everybody to but AKG Headphones because AKG gives quality of service and i have 3 words for AKG is AKG is power of sound.,0
Recently purchased from the website. Received in just a few days. Awesome sound! You would think that you have fullsize headphones.,0
I bought these speakers 2 weeks ago,0
Bought this as a refurb -- couldn't be happier withe the sound,0
this product is the reason i sleep at night. i don't hear the THUMP,0
This device is easy to use via bluetooth or stereo mini with one button controls. The sound quality is crystal clear and outperforms its more expensive competitors anyway.. aghhhummm the Beats Pill.  You will not regret this purchase.,0
STRENGTHS: Awesome tower speaker. One of the best in the price range. The heavy MDF cabinet blocks all colorization of sound. Direct radiated sound projects very clearly and smoothly to front. High quality fit,0
I've both the first two soundlinks and they are very good but this one beats all of them by 110%. I love the way it sounds especially because it a 360 sound. It's got a very good mixture of bass and treble. It sound amazing.,0
So good iv bought 2 Extremes... Now if youve heard one... You Know how Sweet they play... The Link Feature is Amazing and DOUBLE the Sound quality,0
I bought these for surround speakers to use with JBL LSR 308’s in front. They match up very well and create a good surround field. Also the shallow depth keeps them from being too intrusive in the room.,0
Just got my speaker today and I already love it.The advertisement the box portrays is perfect. this is also the most clear speaker I've ever owned.JBL I can't wait to see what you guys come up with next because i will definitely be interested. Good job with this product it's flawless.,0
Love listening to my audibles and music when I run on these,0
I bought this about a year ago and it still sounds great and is still my favorite speaker even over the flip 3 that I also own,0
some of the best 6x9's ive ever heard hooked up to an amp....very impressed....my pioneer 4x6's cant be heard up front anymore...those are getting switched out too now....,0
Great System!!! I'm so so happy with this tremendous sound!!! I'll never need cinema to enjoy sound again!!!,0
I installed 3 LC265i in wall speakers with enclosures during construction,0
Quick to charge and connect with my phone.  Clip broke pretty quickly but was able to order more.  Very comfortable!,0
Overall,0
I have bought this because I was tired of buying Headphones that wouldn't work and this are the perfect ones I love them,0
These are great headphones delivering quality sound and stable connection.  Downside if you lose a bud you have to purchase a new set altogether,0
I purchased this system it first came out. I actually ended up purchasing another. It is super easy to use,0
Stumbled on this during my trip to dessert hill premium outlet.  Blown away with the audio quality,0
I have this a single 10 with 350 watts going to it and it hits pretty good. Its not the loudest out there,0
And a design belonging in an art museum. I've wanted these speakers since they were introduced back in the G4 Cude days. They sound amazing,0
Great speaker.  Does very well with all types of music and as fronts in a home theater set-up.  Sound from the RTi8's approach that of live music.  A good subwoofer (like the ps404) adds LFE (low frequency effect) that I absolutely need for movies and deeper bass-intensive music.,0
Had these for a few months now,0
Running these on a Denon 3313 with a Polk PSW505  sub-woofer and Polk CSi5 Center channel. In one word,0
I purchased the speaker a few weeks ago. I wanted something small for my desk at work. This is perfect. The sound is great.,0
Bought it 2 years ago. Undoubtedly the best purchase I made! I've paired it with Acoustimass Bass 300 and my home sound like a theater.,0
I was very satisfied with the complete package.  The center and sats. and sub are accurate with a good punch.  Does all the things a hand picked surround set can do without the hassle.  I can't imagine there are many equals or superiors to this set other than their more expensive counterparts.,0
It's the best Noise canceling headset money can buy,0
The 2 pairs of db1001 tweeters are an awesome addition to my Polk 6 x 9s (back) and my Polk 6.5s (front) in my 95 Mustang.  Simply clear,0
Just out the box and they sound great but I do believe the people who have had serious issues with them as I had the older acoustic 15 headset and one cup has failed after a year and for the expensive price I paid that should not happen.,0
I won my Mini speaker at a work related function. I'm familiar with the Boss product.  The sound with this Mini Speaker is powerful. I love it.,0
We have the flip 2 (I got it for my birthday 2 years ago and really haven't seen it much since.) My husband stole it back. So when I found these on sale for 69.99 @ NFM I bought one in MY favorite color. It is even better than the first one. You won't be disappointed.,0
I was hesitant to get another Bluetooth set of headphones because my previous set from another brand had a connections issue. But these connect instantly and sound great!,0
This product is much better compared with the original one. Much better sounds quality and I am pretty sure the THD+ N level is much less than the original one. I am kinda impressive about this design. Good job.,0
Got to say these are the best headphones that’s ever been on the high street !!!! The sound and settings are outstanding!!! Bose is the best product and would never buy any other music or sound product !!!! Love love love bose,0

Nice constructions and quality,0
I have had my Charge 4 since Black Friday and am truly impressed with the sound quality. I have paired it with my Flip 4's and it really fills any room with incredible sound quality.,0
Just like another poster - the cord doesn't stay connected. I have to keep pushing it in - and I'm not moving around very much. But,0
I love the sound for a small device it pumps loud it’s the Best Buy I’m very impressed and can’t wait to take it on my holidays to create my own mini rave,0
The unit I bought was a refurbished unit.  It works great,0
Completes the set of JBL Studio 1 series I have in my bedroom surround system. The complete series sounds great in my room.,0
It definately puts my old center to shame.  I don't have to turn it up as much as I used to.  Sounds great with movies,0
Great sound at a great price. Has a very nice design that perfectly matches my plasma tv. Love the option of the stands because I don't like hanging things.,0
I've had mine for a few years and they are awesome! They fit perfectly in my ears and never fall off. They are super comfortable... best earphones out there!,0
This is just a great little speaker. I can take it in the pool with me and connect it right to my phone. Comes in different colors and sounds snazzy. It's super small too so you can just toss it right in your bag and take it anywhere. I'd recommend it.,0
I bought these a month ago to complete my 7.2ch Sony STR-DN1050 capability. I have them setup as my front high surrounds. They rise to the o,0

I tried the beats by Dre & Returned them & ones I put these on Forgetaboutit !! The sounds fantastic & the noise cancellation is great.I love them !!!,0
Excellent very easy to install and the volume is crystal clear. I would recommend the Bose Solo system to anyone who needs clarity of sound,0
This speaker is truly amazing. Sounds great,0

I baught my set about 14 years ago and they've put up with a lot . Thats why I gave them 5 stars and the only down side is the powered sub at the time didn't have a gain control like it does now . Great beginner set .,0

Got it,0

I really like the one wire connection and the way I can get rid of all my controllers. it took alittle while to program,0
I have scoured the internet looking for a replacement sub-woofer and I found this complete set cheaper then just replacing one speaker. The set looks brand new and I could not be happier,0
I compared it to the much expensive speakers from the competition (~200$ price range),0
d isc cd (blinking) display on both manual and remote....does not play CD. all other functions work fine. Any suggestions?,0

I bought these over the summer as replacements to my blown stock speakers,0

It has great features however $149.99 is too much for the price.  I wish they will reduce the price or offer better sales.,0
I purchased it a Few month ago and the sound quality is great.  I took it to an outdoor get together a few weeks ago and all my friends and neighbors were floored by the sound quality og this device.,0
I just got it in the mail today,0
I can't say enough about this center speaker from Polk.  It's clarity and dispersion from SACD's are amazing!  I also view alot of DVD's and dialogue and background music rocks!  Polk has made a high quaility center speaker.,0
These headphones are honestly brilliant. Amazing sound quality and by far the most comfortable pair of headphones on the market. I once used them for 12 hours straight with no problems whatsoever. Would recommend these to anyone.,0
There was one of these at the vacation home I rented this summer. I used it a LOT. Simple,0
These headphones are great and the bass is comparable to my beats,0
The Studio LC-2 gives you superb sound quality not only with film soundtracks,0
ive had mine for almost a year now and i still love it as much as the day i got it,0

I just bout it and the sound qulity is truly stunning. I cant stop listening to it. And it's only $99!!!!!!!!!!!,0
Really good fit in the ears and good bass. The wireless flexibility is really useful while using it in the gym. Taking calls is easy and the mic works well. It was really easy to set up using the bose connect app. The battery lasts a good 5-6 hours for me and the charging case is a good utility.,0
i have been using the flip 2 sounds great so i picked up the lastest one Flip4 the sound that comes out of it great fills the room and has a larger battery from the first one i have. worth the money spent,0
The headphones have great sound considering their size.   However I often cut grass and leave my Iphone on the porch when streaming WIFI data.   I noticed these dropped out when I did certain movements within their operating range,0
Recently got my first Bose wave radio with CD player and absolutely love it. its operation is really easy reception is fantastic sound quality is unsurpassed,0
It sounds better than I expected.  It's compact yet has big sound.  I was surprised by how clean it sounded.  Although it is a small speaker,0
Glad this is my first headphone ever,0

I just bought this speaker and I couldn't wait to try it out. Exceeded my expectations easily,0
Este nene es peque?o pero retumba. Desajusto todas las ventanas de mi casa. Da un sonido seco,0
Easy to use. HI-Quality sound with extra bass. Crystal clear sound. Comfortable to use. Noise canceling.,0
Sounds great and well worth every penny. i have it intergrated with the tsi 100 rears and tsi200 fronts. i have it all powered by the denon 591 600 watts 5.1. but u are able to do 7.1 with this denon so i can wait to get more tsi100 to use as 2nd rear set of speakers.,0
I bought this for my wife and after using it I'm getting one for me. nice and loud. seems like it should be durable. well made.,0
THIS IS THE BEST CENTER CHANNEL EVER! We bought this new when it first came out,0
Outstanding bass and mids and highs. Light wright and comfortable and don't make my ears sweat like my over the ear bose Quiet Comfort headphones do. Make and take phone calls listwn to music and enjoy a really great sound I didn't expect from an on ear  design.,0
I bought this speaker for my tablet and listing to music at work . Awesome little speaker for performance and price point . Bought this speaker on sale from jbl for $19.95 free two day shipping. Will buy several for friends and family for Christmas .,0
Versatile fit. Great sound. Good value. Although I have not had them long,0
I am so happy with my small speaker. I can take it anywhere. Load and clear sound. Wish I could find more for only $20.00!..,0
My husband bought me the Bose Soundlink Color speaker in mint. It has great sound,0
I have this subwoofer for more than 10 years and never failed me.  The bass is clear and will rock even your living room. It's a bargain for the price if you consider the quality.,0
Amazing sound for the price! I work in a loud laundry room and this speaker rules over all the noise.,0
Great concept,0
Bought these babies about 3 days ago and have been enjoying the sound quality and comfort (to the point I forget I have them on). Sometimes I loose the connection on the left side of my ear but maybe that's my phone because at they seem fine. I do want to sun with them in the rain (can't wait),0
I slept great alone but once I started to sleep with my girlfriend her sleep apnea and snoring would wake me up consistently. Now I will wake up here and there but get to sleep easily. Some of the sounds keep me up,0
I found these at Walmart almost by accident. I would recommend these to any ardent audiophile looking for great sound at the price point. -- Ignore the naysayers.,0
Got these for a friend as birthday present and shes really happy with the fit,0
Got this baby as my birthday Gift and i am loving it :)  ps - i am not able to get any pouch/cover for travel purpose online anywhere for thsi device,0
Quite reasonable sound quality for its size provided you don’t turn it up too loud. Some subtle feet to stop it rolling about would have been good. Hopefully it keeps working.,0
My brother got one 2 months ago ,0
I added this speaker to replace a tiny center speaker. I've been replacing my speakers a little at a time,0
Since purchasing the unit we have notice the improved quality of sound as we are both in our 70th year,0
I have Bose speakers for my internet,0
I use this every day. Easy to use,0
Bought these for my grandson. He loves them!!! They have great sound. Great bass he says. The color is amazing!!,0
I'll simply say this. I lost mine. I dropped them at the airport. I'm probably buying a new pair. That should tell you all you need to know,0
Everything is great,0
Got a SoundTouch 20 for my birthday and just love it. I can walk into the room and press one of the presets and my favourite internet radio station Adore Jazz place instantly.,0

Purchased for children (maybe to loud for kids) blue and white,0
I still need a small portable speaker and this JBL small square does the job. I am old school and still have small audio devices,0
Great sound reproduction from simple speeches to full orchestra to rock and everything inbetween ... plus the added benefit of bluetooth ... fantastic!,0
Great compact speaker with good sound quality. Doesn’t come with a mains lead though just a USB charger,0
Would definitely recommend this one to  friend. I bought 2 of this already (black and grey) the other one as a gift to my brother. Easy to use,0
Comfortable. Stylish. Durable. Awesome. There is nothing wrong with these headphones. Also they come with Google Assistant?!?! Too good to be true.,0
The UA Sport Wireless train are a fantastic set of headphones and provided excellent sound. The materials definitely feel high quality and were comfortable to wear as well. Good base as well as midlevels and highs,0
Ok,0
I bought it 2 weeks back and I am enjoying it so far and liked it very much. Previous ones of other brands were not good. I am happy with this one.,0
Between the noise cancelling and sound quality these are the best headphones on the market hand down. Great design,0
Make sure you take approval from your neighbors before playing this beast. This is undoubtedly best in business!,0
I am very impressed with the Bose bass module 500. It works great with the Bose sound bar and helps give me surround sound with great quality. Its simple to hookup and operate.,0
"Can't believe the quality vs the price. I use it with some desktop speakers for the best LYNC ""speakerphone"" I could imagine!",0
best sub woofer god has ever put on the planet!!! installed in a small ported box i have sales reps from other companies wondering where the 12' sub is. i laugh at them! the bass is so punchy and controlled.,0
I bought this speaker because I wanted to hear music in other parts of the house. I am pleasantly surprised about the quality of the sound and the range,0
I have been a big Bose Fan for years. When you listen to music you will hear instruments you never heard on regular head phones.  I absolutely recommend these to everyone.,0
I gave this a rating of 10 across the board because of size and sound this JBL Charge after listing to other brands for the price and size.And the time you have on a full charge with this will last as is said.,0
These are by far the best headphones I have ever purchased. Noise cancelling is brilliant - well worth the investment as I listen to audiobooks a lot.,0
This is my second pair,0
One of the best subs out I was very happy with the way they sounded hooked to an 1000w amp clear clean bass. I recommend these,0
Added the sound bar and subwoofer to my flat screen,0

Working or hiking,0
put this amp in my suburban with a pair of kicker subs this amp is the real goods sounds clean and pumps my 12's im sold great product,0
Ive had these for over a year and hooked to 100watts rms. They sound really good. I thought they'd be cheap junk and by no means are they.,0
For the money,0
Bought these a couple years ago. I currently have 8 running my pool area,0
Definitivamente es un producto que cumple con todas las expectativas en calidad de sonido de alta fidelidad,0
This is the best sound system ever. Did not realise how much we were missing sound wise when watching T.V. Brilliant.,0
Great sound. Volume fine. No problem pairing or connecting with my Ipod,0
I have only had the BB for a couple of weeks but it is fantastic,0
"I bought these 8 years ago.  I thought about upgrading to a newer ""model"" and put these in another room.  Once I did some research and listening tests",0
So far,0
Just readin the reviews and they look good,0
I purchased this unit for a 5.1 surround system and it really fills in the lows very well. I do recommend setting the crossover of the sub and your receiver for best results. Really brings out the bass - and this comes from a bass guitar player.,0
Good sound,0
I’ve had my speaker for a little bit now and I absolutely love it! The sound quality is phenomenal! It holds a charge for so long,0
I bought this as a speaker for the golf cart and for the pool. The sound is fantastic as are some of its features,0
I bought this speaker off Amazon for $116,0
It’s crazy how quickly I go to sleep. Really love these. Suggest using buds size slightly smaller than fitting perfectly,0
Very versatile. Works well through the spectrum from light overdrive to moderate metal tone. I do wish the high gain was stronger,0
All my friends are so jealous. They can't believe such a great sound can come from an invisible speaker,0
Bought to replace factory fitted Landrover Defender speakers. These offer much better quality of sound.,0
Pulse 2 is one of the best wireless speakers out there in the market. The light is really cool. If you use it at night at camps it's really cool. The sound is amazing and I never had any trouble with bluetooth connectivity. Also it's really light and strong.,0
Bought it a couple of years ago so it stands up well over time.  Only issue for me is a can't seem to find a way to switch it to Bluetooth remotely. Sucks having to walk to the unit and press the button to activate Bluetooth. Am I missing something?,0
I just finished installing one of these subs into the trunk of my Grand Am and it really kicks. This is the second subwoofer I have ever had my my car,0
I purchased a pair at Circuit City and was expecting no surprises as I use them as mains replacing a pair of Monitor30's.I am very happy with the change.Polk still rules!,0

a great piece of design,0

This is a great speaker. Size / Sound Quality is best in class I think,0
These speakers are excellent.  Crystal clear highs,0
I love this headphones. I've owned a lot of BOSE Products and they have not disappoint me yet. I purchase one for myself and bought two extra to give to friends as a gift. Please don't change you technology because it is awesome as it is.,0
Find me another pair of bookshelf speakers that deliver the crisp and deep sound that these do,0
I have had my JBL Flip for a couple of years.  I use it during workouts,0
This is a great speaker for the price.  Very good bass response but I would say at higher volumes it really lacks treble.   You need a music player with an equaliser to correct this.  Very pleased with the speaker overall and would definitely recommend.,0
I picked these up on Boxing day Great sound clear crisp with a strong sound. If you want mid to deep base you need a woofer (which you should have anyway)  Great speaker would highly recomend,0
Really pleased with the quality of these headphones. Great looking and the sound quality is excellent,0
This little speaker is very powerful and has great sound. I got it for my 17 year old nephew for a gift,0
Purchased two JBL 305P MKII studio monitors for a computer room studio,0
Overall a very solid speaker. Great components and solid construction allow it to make for great movie watching.  Also,0
I bought this a few weeks ago and I like it. The only thing I didn’t like was when I opened it it was a little bit dirty but besides that it’s a good Bluetooth speaker.,0
Purchased a week ago and without a doubt it's made TV viewing a hundred fold more inclusive: only been watching the Australian Open tennis so far and it's terrific. Can't wait to use it with Netflix next week!,0
I'm just a day into using the Flip 2. Dirt easy setup. Syncs with no issues. Great and loud sound for such a small can.,0
I have had this system for just a few weeks,0
I bought these for my husband's computer and he loves them. He wanted some for Christmas and almost bought himself another brand. He is glad that he didn't.,0
Really easy to use and the beauty of it is you can take it anywhere easily and even though it's compact - the sound when I turned it up full blast was insane!,0
I bought this system a few days ago and the install was very easy. The best part is when I turned on the system and all I said was WOW! What sound comes out of this small unit and not to forget the deeeeeep sounds that comes from the Subwoofer. Amazing!,0
Fantastic sound quality. This product will ensure you never need another speaker attached to your TV again. Surround sound from such a neat & tidy little box. We love it. Another excellent product from Bose.,0
Recently picked this item up and have to say it is super easy to setup and use. Plug it in,0
Bought this for my 12yr. son in 2010. Outstanding build quality,0
I bought a set of noise canceling buds and had them a year they broke from using them at the gym.. Took them to a Bose store No bill 2-3 days past the years warranty .. They look at them looked up the serial number and gave me a new set no questions .. WHAT A Stand Up Company ..,0
Just received this speaker as a gift for my bday,0
I probably wouldn't have bought them had they not been on sale,0
I bought them on Samsung and loved the sound. Unfortunately I have turn them back because they were too heavy and loose for me. I have an small head and felt it uncomfortable.Also they were too bulky,0
I bought these in Bose store in Glasgow they were cheaper on web but staff said they would match price . The headset I works perfectly with my Ipad Air no issues would certainly recommend them great clarity,0
This lil guy is amazing... the sound quality is superb for such a portable package...it is everything and more for what I wanted.,0

Fell off my motorcycle and still works. Great sound and endless possibilities to use this speaker. Will forever love JBL.,0
I have had this for a few months now and it is our go to speaker. We put it on in the kitchen and can hear it throughout the house. It's also great for the nights we're outside grilling and swimming.,0
These speakers are awesome. They sound as good if not better than many speakers priced well above them. They fill up a medium-sized room very nicely,0
Excellent sounding and great features.  It seriously needs a snooze button on top of the unit.  The remote is fine for everything else.  But please add some buttons!!!!!,0
I was expecting this feature long time ago...ir is great to have it now! what about noise reduction?,0
Cool headphones really like them.Thanks to the battery I could use them all day wirelessly. Clear,0
Iv'e had this since before Christmas and me and the kids love it especially when watching films. Great value for money.,0

I took a chance on these after reading a very convincing comparison on wirecutter and so far they have lived up to the hype.I would like to cut the cord and go Bluetooth,0
The size is so small but the sound is huge and clear than I expected!!! I’m going to buy one more for my husband.,0
I love music and with these headsets,0
Great piece of equipment.  Easy to hook up and use.  If only XM had 5.1 surround sound,0
These speakers sound good.  I was expecting speakers that would not sound good wihtout a subwoofer,0
Awesome grin inducing sound. Worth every penny. Simple connections and set up. Very very pleased with this system and cannot recommend it highly enough.,0
The classic look with the outstanding sound is the perfect combination. I am so happy with the timeless look of these speakers,0

Smaller than I thought,0
Use this every morning while getting ready (use iPhone 5 w-Pandora)....very stable connection,0
My wife and I have been very impressed by the XRt12 tuner.  It was very easy to set up and produces a pure crisp sound quality that both of us enjoy very much.  We would recommend the XRt12 to anyone contemplating an in-home satellite radio installation.,0
Bought the JBL Go as a late stocking stuffer for my girls.  The price pulled me in,0
when i tried this soundbar in the pc richards store it sound amazing i took it home blew my mind  this soundbar sounds so clear you don't need any other speaker. trust me...,0
Please demo these with Mumford and Sons 'Home'. Must be heard to be believed. Place the Bose Soundlink Mini in a small square section of a cupboard 1 or 2 foot cubed,0
Just purchased and the best sound quality,0
I have really tall ceilings.  I mounted them on the wall eleven feet in the air and they sound like they are pointing at me anywhere in the room.  They sound tight and crisp even at high volume.  I think these are my favorite speakers I own.,0
I just got mine 9/22/17 took my time to install actually read manual. These replaced my Bose speakers. The difference between night and day. If you’re looking for awesome surround these are audio file quality.,0
Needed something small for work. Since they banned us from playing music too loud. And It looks like this one is going to be ok.,0
I bought these earbuds yesterday and so far I’m extremely impressed! The sound is incredible as you’ve come to expect from Bose. My two favorite features so far is the fact the case itself doubles as a normal case to store them but,0
I am very pleased with the sound an looks of my Wave system III. It is just the unit I have been looking for.,0
Way way way better than my Bose and Samsung soundbar. Affordable and easy to set up. No issues with wireless soundbar syncing. I LOVE the voice volume control.,0
It is the best one in this price range. One will wonder how come such a small box can give such amazing sound quality. I am also planning to take this with me in my travels and adventures.,0
I just bought this today and I have to say this speaker is WAY BETTER than the beats pill and its really cheap! This thing doesn't disappoint!!,0
Sub and speakers are great!! The only thing that kept it from 5 stars is the not so easy wall mounts! Wall mounting should not be this complicated .,0
I purchased this speaker system in October of 2002.  When I first listened to this particular system it blew me away...I was very impressed....and the price was right...899.00,0
i gotta say.. nothing can prepare you for the quality and the comfort of k 701. it's worth every penny:) but this speakers deserv much more then just mp3 formats.. everthing comes together when you play cd's in the livingroom.. truly a real masterpiece:),0
I have a pair of K612 Pro headphones so I was hoping the AKG earphones sounded as good. They do. very rich and bright with a strong bass. I suppose the N40s are even better but at this price I don't think you will find a better sounding in-ear earphones,0
Has great sound! Very clear sound with smooth bass. Love Bose and customer for life! Products are awesome have the surround sound and the smaller wave etc. Highly recommend!,0
THIS SET OF BOOKSHELFS WORK WELL FOR MY MAIN 2 FRONT SPEAKERS.  I HAVE THESE WITH THE 100 WATT POLK SUB.,0

With limited choices for a dash speaker,0
Been using this for couple of years. They are good. Also gifted a few to my family and friends and they love it .,0

I have 5 of these microphones that I use with field recorders in the video production business. They work extremely well and have solved many of our audio problems. I don't know about compatibility problems with some equipment,0
I had a chance to try them and I was really impressed with the quality,0
Picked these babies up for **** each at employee discount (be jealous).  Simly amazing sound quality. Greaty range and clarity,0
The CSi A6 is an excellent center channel speaker,0
I bought these to replace my iPOD original earphones cause i dont like their quality and dont have any kind of bass. After using them,0
Just bought this CSi40 for my front center channel speaker and moved the CS300 to the rear for my 6.1 system. Wow! what a difference. Hurry up and go get one of these. I paid a close out price of $279 with free interest for a year. Nice bonus,0
Absolutely love my AM 10 speakers! In my view Bose makes the best speakers/headphones out there and they are the only speakers we buy at my house. :-),0

Gave these to my boy friend as a gift and he loves them and says they work,0

Bought nearly two months ago and have nothing to complain about. Great noise cancelling and comfortable fit.,0
This sound systems works very well for working out in the gym. This replaced our older surround system eliminating all those wires. Love it  One note though is the amount of glue used to hold the sticker on. What is good to lean it off notice I still have my sticker on because of it.,0
Bought this for my husband for Christmas and have not been disappointed. We have a very large lounge and the quality of sound from this is superb. Thank you Bose.,0
I bought these for my girlfriends birthday to watch her pad before bed. She loves them great quality sound. I went with jbl because I've always known them to be good sound from years ago when I was 18 out clubbing these are the speakers clubs used,0
These are the best speakers Ive evered owned. Sound quality is fantastic. These speakers sound very clean and clear. Im using a cheap amp and they still sound great. I would recommend these speakers to anyone.,0
I bought it about 3-4 months ago and think it sounds great. I like how I can only use my phone to turn it in with Bluetooth and it starts playing music after a few seconds. The mounting on the back will work,0
Really good,0
I got them a few months ago looking forward to work in the office without being disturbed by surrounding noise. It worked and when I fly and use them I thank God QC25 are with me.,0
I was absolutely astonished at how much sound i got with how little money i paid for these headphones! They are amazing,0
I've had several of these headphones because I like them so much. I have a set in my vehicle,0
Wow... these things pound! Got me into a car club - Midwest Hitters,0
Nice sound,0
Lucky to get this for my birthday having got through several cheaper similar types. So far could not be more impressed,0
What a fantastic speaker! Highs and lows are superb,0
Totally amazing,0
I got this pair as a birthday present 2 years ago and I love them ever since. The over the ears cup ensures that sound quality is not compromised. The sound quality certainly beats all the in ear or on ear earphones and headphones I have owned.,0
I finally installed these little guys on my walls. Not only do they sound amazing but they also look great on the walls. I hooked them to my Denon A/V Receiver and films like Saving Private Ryan come alive. The realism is scary.,0
I just bought the black and mint around ears and they are great! I love listening to music on them and they have great style which my friends all love once they saw I got them. Well done Bose!,0
very good sound,0
I was sooooo happy with this speaker,0
Installed into 2007 Avalanche rear doors,0
I bought two sets of these and put them in a fiberglass enclosure on my wakeboard tower. These things are loud. Im pushing just over 100 watts per speaker and they sound great.,0
I've got that as birthday present and now I use it every day! Never at max volume because it's very powerful!,0
I have mine in the back seat of a 1964 Pontiac. Love this unit as it fills my Classic with such sound. My old am radio just can not compete!  Great engineering,0
The sound quality on these things is unbelievable and very 'neutral' which is what one seeks when looking for studio headphones,0
Not only does this speak sound amazing but I was able to link it to a friends JBL and they both played from my play list and just using the two speakers was enough for our small party! I want to buy another just for this reason alone!,0
"These subs are the best.  I have been through 10 sets of different subs this year.  These are 5 times smoother than the DB's.  I have out beat 2 15s and out beat 3 12"" Kickers with only 2 of the MOMOs.  Im running one of my old DBs now too.  Polk is #1!!!!!!!!!",0
I use these headphones strictly working out and love them! Although the size is a lot bigger than most in ear buds,0
It is a great product. connected it. it gave me an update which happened over the air. connects with bluetooth so i could listen to any song that i want. Would be great if there was support of Gaana+ on the sound touch app but bluetoth saves the day.,0
Comfortable and stay in place even on long sweaty runs,0
I have to carry two cell phone and this Bose can work with 2 at a time,0
An American friend had bought one of these black boxes and raved about it. I bought one to see if I agreed. I do! Broad deep sound across the spectrum and head and shoulders above the built in speakers in the TV. Need to remember to turn off TV sound for best results.,0
Sometimes a little buggy and has to be reset by plugging in and holding the magic button,0
Amazing sound quality on rock music,0
Finally broke and bought the Wave IV. Wish I had done it sooner. I love it. The sound is incredible. Been listening to CDs all evening. Unbelievable how good my CDs and radio sounds.,0
Best set of headphones I've ever used. They're so good my teenager uses them in public even though they aren't the 'teen brand'.,0
This sub is amazing let me tell you. i got a alpine 750 watt amp running 350 rms hooked up to this (db1212) and i get noticed were ever i go... theres no doubt the cops can here me,0
This is a really cool speaker,0
Theses things arte monsters! They are a little big and heavy but they sound fantastic and worth the bulky size in my opinion (which is the only one that counts,0
I love my speaker! It sounds and works great. I have had no problems with the bluetooth pairing. My phone was in a different room and no problems with the connection. Going to buy more as gifts!!,0
Very happy with 2.1 speakers rather than having a 5.1 with more cables everywhere Gives cinema experience base and quality,0
I've had this speaker for just two weeks and have been raving about it ever since. It's loud,0
People it's a dock your suppose to put your iPhone on it it's not wireless or have a remote just for that reason just be happy you got it. Worlds best sound system in the world.,0
i got these for christmas they may be a little pricey but there worth it they made me never want to use wired headphones ever again.,0
These are the best period. I recently got 2 of these and they hit harder and cleaner than audiobahn,0
Pretty much have,0
What a steal. ....purchased these last week at less than 1/4 cost with free shipping. My new favorites ear buds. Should've ordered more,0
This is a great speaker,0
Bought this for my girlfriend to take with her to Belize,0
Note i`m giving five stars. If these DXI650`s are any thing like the polk 5x7`s I just brought i`m in for a wonderful listening experience replacing factory system in my 99 Silverado more to come.,0
These should NEVER have been put down like a old horse. I really hope Polk comes out with something in the future,0
Its not quite what I expected but its giving me some great new options for new sounds... I definitely dig it and for the price you can't beat it !!!,0
Appearance ,0
The JBL Charge 3 is made to enjoy it in full power,0
Bought for son to travel with. Sounds so clear and loud for such a small speaker and best part not distorted.  Thanks JBL,0
Just received my Sleepbuds and I am enjoying them very much.  Great not having headset wires connected to my phone all night.   I can't wait until they add more sounds.  Would be great if they would be able to get the sounds from the White Noise app on iTUNEs their sounds are great.,0
EXCELLENT SOUND QUALITY THE SPEKAR NOT HAVE MUCH SPACE IN ROOM I ALWAYS RECOMMEND IT HEY PEOPLE WHEN YOU ARE PURCHASE IT YOU WILL LOVE TI,0
We purchased this wave radio W- multi changer for christmas. We love the sound so much we are getting ready to buy a second one for the bedroom!! Hesitated for awhile because of price but found out its worth every penny!!,0
When you know audio-when you LOVE audio,0
Was worried about them falling out ,0

Enjoying the quality of sound,0
Absolutely fabulous,0
Very surprised at the sound quality and volume from this little speaker. Also charges very fast and has excellent run time. I keep one in my tool bag at work.,0
worth every penny! for those who just want to tune out the world for the few min or hours in a car-bus-train-airplane... this is it!,0
I have not used this speaker a lot yet,0
Absolutely delighted,0
The no tangle magnetic back and flat wire are almost as awesome as the easy in super comfy ear tips and super sound. Hopefully durability will excell as well? To be continued,0
I bought this item before Christmas,0
this are my first noise canceling headphones,0
They are perfect,0
I've had one of these connected to my TV for years,0
I have been listening to my SoundLink Color 2 for 7 months and recently connected to my Echo Dot. WOW....Sounds Fantastic and the music is so clean,0
These speakers replaced a much larger set from the 90s and I couldn't beleive how a speaker this size would improve my listening experience.,0
I am enjoying my SoundTouch30 and SoundTouch20.  I especially like having preset buttons for easy access to my favorite stations.  One option that would make this even better would be a wake-up alarm similar to what the Sonos players have. Other than that,0
Its is a fantastic product. Didn't expect this much of quality. Fantastic Bass and Surround. Bluetooth Streaming is beautiful from Laptop and iPhone. Go for it and never go for a second thought.,0
I love these earbuds. I got them for Christmas and I forgot them in my pocket while my pants went through the washer machine. I tested them out and they work perfectly! I've also accidentally fully submerged them in water and they still work!,0
I am giving it 5 stars for what it is... a super compact,0
This is definitely  a great improvement over the  flip 3 with bass reaching deeper and clearer highs than the flip 3. My favorite  new feature  is jbl connect plus ,0
you only need 1 of these monsters,0
Nice subwoofer! just bought that today,0
Sony STR-DH520 + Polk RM705 sub/satellites + 2 Monitor 50's = Sonic perfection!!!  I cannot fathom a better sounding set up.,0
I recently purchased this bar to install in my new RV and was completely satisfied with its performance! Size is perfect for the RV and the connectivity makes listening to my tunes easy!,0
I live on a small sailboat. I have two pair mounted in the extreme corners of my cabin driven through a splitter. I can tune the system to make the speakers disappear and have my music floating in space for complete sensory enjoyment. I simply love them. Thanks Dr. Bose,0
These are the best speakers I have ever owned. Absolute best value for hard earned money. I love them.,0
I LOVE these earphones! I have abnormally small ears and these are the ONLY pair or earphone that fit in my ears without make my ears sore. They also sound incredible. I don't know what I would do without them.,0
I bought this speaker to stream music from my iPhone and it sounds great. Plus I can take it anywhere and the battery life seems exceptional,0
I love this speaker,0
if your thinking of paying $350 for the Klipsch sub,0
I bought Q35 few weeks back and in hindsight,0
Nice unit,0
I have had these speakers for 8 years -  go no further to research which outdoor speakers to buy. These are clear at ANY volume. Winter,0
I love how this speaker is easy to pack,0
I bought this 1 week ago and I'm so happy! I use them in the gym and in the office ... at all times! It was a very good choice ..,0
I use my Sound Link with my IPad and never cease to be astonished by the quality of the sound. On a driving trip to Italy recently I used it in the car linked to the IPad and Sat Nav. Worked a treat with the sat nav over riding the music when instructions were needed. Best purchase for a long time.,0
I've had these nearly a year now and they are a fabulous piece of kit. No more wires and the sound quality is awesome. The only down side is the restriction on the sound volume,0
These are all the best earbuds you may have. Great sound and great design.  It would be great if these ones could be used on videogame consoles such as playstation 4 or xbox due to its great capabilities,0
A good quality product that lived up to expectations could do a slight improvement on Sound quality bit muddy on the lower overall a good sound great for general listening and would definitely recommend to any other customers.,0
I love these speakers! I bought a pair to replace the ones in my front doors that blew a year or so ago. The sound is such a huge improvement,0
5 stars for a model that you can swim with,0
These headphone are definitely worth your money. These have great sound cancellation and sound quality. I didn't expect such good quality headphones seeing I didn't quite like other headphones at this price.,0
I fell asleep with this on. I laid down listening to music,0
Used for over 1 month,0
I bought my first Bose Wave 6 or more years ago. Very happy with it. I prefer the top controls. I would like to buy another,0
Don't let the price fool you! These are audiophile sperkers.  Their sound is clear,0
I've had my speakers for 6 years now and they still sound as good as the day I bought them.  It would be great if Bose did a refresh and added blue tooth to sync up to my Surface Pro.  Seems like all the newer computers these days are cutting down on the number of USB ports which is a pain.,0
unbelievable the bass this subwoofer puts out id recommend a sealed enclosure for this sub. i would at least run a 800 watt amplifier to it also.,0
I've had my wave music system since 2012... Now and every time i turn it on it's like the first time i fell in love with Music. Great buy!!!!,0
Amazing product,0
My wife and I use them when travelling on our motorcycle. They are the best way to listen while riding,0
Received the jbl link 300 today. Quick easy setup excellent sound quality just like other jbl products I own the googLe assistant feature is very useful it can pick up on commands from the entry way roughly 20 feet away. I am very satisfied with this unit,0
I bout this only a week ago and it is definitely worth the money. the sound quality sounds like it is a huge speaker!! great bass,0
have had my Potable Soundock for over 5 years and was looking for another one,0
Like the product,0
"Awesome Speakers!!!! WOW!!! I have never heard Bookshelf Speakers the sound as good as these do. It is incredible that 5 1/4"" speakers could sound so vibrant. I turned my sub off to see what these speakers could do. I had to take a double check to see if my sub was off. Great Job Polk!!",0
This is a great addition to my TV..great crisp sound,0
I bought this because i thought they were the best headphones i could get and i was completely right.,0
These are now my best headphones and easily surpass the performance of my Bose and AKG headphones for home or travel listening,0
Have owned the cs350 going on 8 years now and it produces great sound just like it did when I bought it new!  Smooth sound and makes the transition from left,0
Fits great in my ears,0
I bought mine this Saturday,0
I was hesitant to buy given the price! Definitely glad I did! Have made the work environment much more peaceful and flights a breeze!,0
This system is the most incredible,0
These headphones are amazing,0
Bass is next level,0
Bought this sound bar right before Thanksgiving and so so glad we did. It sounds awesome,0
my wife bought this for me and my chin hit the floor when fist heard the sound can't stop listening to my music !!,0
Great rugged little speaker,0
I have had the pair of speakes for 2 months so cool .. they link up with the sound touch 30 so well .. and i got the sound touch wirerless so i have 5 speakes running and the hole thing is the best.. two of them are lgs sound bar and bass works just great,0
I bought it 3 months ago,0
The overalldesign and sound quality is superb and very compact sound system. I would recommand this product to all the music lovers.,0
Great sound quality for the price.  Build quality is solid and handsome.  I've put this center channel through some rough testing and its passed in flying colors everytime.  Awesome product for the price.,0
I bought 2 of these as gifts for my family but know that I tried them out i definitely want some to put throughout the house. Because you can sink them together. I really recommend these.,0
I set this up on a corner desk around the big monitor,0
Price is good for the quality,0
Bought more than a year ago. First connected to a Marantz PM5005 amp and now connected to Marantz Melody stream(MCR510) Excellent sound quality. Only draw back is it is bit fiddly to connect the cables into the terminals.,0
I bought on new year,0
I bought these for my kids and i ended up taking 1 pair (i ordered 2) so i can lay in bed and watch movies off netflix while my husband is sleeping. They are comfortable and no one else can hear what you are listening to which is perfect for my husband who is a very light sleeper.,0
Bought these little beauties in Dec 2015 by far the best headphones I've ever owned superb sound and comfortable to wear enough said. Top product,0
Excellent quality and great price. Bought these for my son.  He wanted a very expensive pair of headphones and now he’s very happy with these.  Happy son,0
We have a JBL Flip 3 and love it.  We purchased the JBL Flip 4,0
"I just put one of these 10""s in my Volkswagen Golf",0
wish you would of gone one step further for the cord to be included in the housing. i'm taking it with me on trips & now have to pack my charger separately?????? Bose you're usually thought of all the details but failed to do so with this product.,0
was given one as a gift and it was lost in hurricane Harvey,0
It's awesome... The sound is very crips and clean... Bass is excellent.... I wish it was louder... Lol... But it's awesome... Turn it all the way up without no distortion at all... Hiahly recommended,0
all i can say are these subs are awsome! circuit city is deleting them i got mine for 65 dollars. thats been a hell of a deal,0
Low self-noise,0
I bought this to enable me to have a speaker in my vehicle as my phone did not have the 1/4 inch regular jack. I have been very satisfied with it. ONly there are time when my iPhone will not connect to it.,0
This is the better one of the 2 solo having had both this is the better one sound is fantastic and the remote easy to set up and use,0
We the new upgrade on JBL connect once you upgrade your charge 3 one now have to option to to off that lound noise it makes when you turn on or off the device making the product 10 times better.,0
I had these for almost a year and I worked them to death,0
Works great with the TV and smart phone ! The technical support department was very helpful with the TV settings that needed to be changed,0
Bought these and have to say they are simply awesome. the sound is crystal clear and the bass amazing! when i first plugged one speaker in my friend couldn't believe it was just one speaker putting out that much sound!,0
Just being able to do a workout,0
I bougth these for my cousin!!! And exelen price!!! Have mamy JBL speaker!!! JBL the best product and best prices!!! Better than bose and Sony and many others!!!,0
Bought this speaker to use at work. Very lightweight. Good sound and just an all out amazing speaker. Would recommend to anyone looling for something small.,0
Very pleased with the performance of these speakers. Excellent clarity,0
the ambient control is a plus I really liked how much sound you can allow from the environment around and I can talk to a person next to me without ever taking off the headphones.,0
The PSW10 is enough of a subwoofer for my needs.  The space I have for home theater is very limited.  Adjusting the volume per the instructions blends this new addition into my speaker array very nicely. Soundbar? Not on my 60-inch LED.  I am ecstatic!,0
bought this 6 months ago bluetoothed it to my i pad ,0
Great earphones for the price and it includes a year membership for MapMyFitness MVP.  Only a couple of things that have not figure out yet.  How to make a call hand free (using an iPhone) and getting an error when trying to upgrade to MVP with the code.,0
Dramatically deep,0
Ive had this product for 1 year and it still sounds like day 1. Awesome sound quality and is very durable!!,0
i went from a psw 100,0
Sound quality is superb to rivals,0
The audio quality is excellent. This was my first JBL product and it sure impressed me. I have already ordered some JBL speakers. I love JBL,0
My Grandfather installed this shortly before giving me his older car,0
Purchased the QC25 full Head Headphone's,0
Bought 4 speakers...and these slim,0
My husband has always had a pair he loves them for his deployments. I do a lot of 5ks and let’s be honest I get into my music. My problem was all my headphones would fall off or out of my ears EXCEPT THESE!!!! Love how power up tells you battery percentage also.,0
I purchased the TL-150 (4 satellites and center) .. they are a great match for my Polk 100W sub I have now. Crisp mid's and highs.. any normal amp will not even hit their limits. Buy them now and you will have many friends giving you praises!,0
I am a drummer and have been looking for some headphones that could give me a faithful representation of my kit for so long. These do the job to say the least! Easy on the ears both sonically and with respect to comfort. Great price and nice touch with the removable/ replaceable cord.,0
Love this product. Took about three days to get used to them. Now can’t sleep without them. My husbands Snoring was ruining my life. I now get four times the sleep and feel so much better!,0
Bought this for my parents over the summer and they loved it!  Just picked one up for my husband and we are very happy.  We had a jbl that we love but decided to upgrade.  Great sound,0
I have mine for about 2 years now and they work as expected I don't know how some people don't like them but they are the best and the most comfortable headphones I have ever worn. I am definitely looking forward to buying another pair.,0
These headphones are a bargain.  The quality is excellent.  They fit nicely and hold a charge for a long time.  The bluetooth connection works well and I can roam around the house while leaving while leaving my phone in any room.  The sound quality is really good for the price.,0
i got this little speaker for my galaxy 4 cell phone and i could be any happier,0
Just wanted to leave this note here. The speakers themselves are fine- but the price doesn't include what you need to mount them to the wall as shown in the product photos. Beware.,0
I actually won these from an airline. Great audio quality,0
Best sound quality and battery life is amazing. I would recommend this unit to anyone who appreciates bass with their music.  Deep and clear sound from this unit and the price is unmatched.,0
Read few -ve comments abt the Bose app,0
I received my pulse to From you all by winning a competion for Damian Lillard's #4BarFriday community. I love the colors,0
It's very loud. The wireless connection is awesome. I could be in any room. It still plays from my phone. I live this item.,0
I bought these again when my previous pair got damaged in a move.  I like the sound.  I did not need Bluetooth so I was happy to find these online and the price was fantastic.,0
Used the 5040 for a new record and it was absolutely amazing! The intimacy of this mic is almost embarrassing. I believe it actually picked up some of the notes I was only thinking about singing. Best ever.,0
Got this to use with my mobile & spotify. The sound quality is fantastic,0
I bought this a month ago and it adds so much to a party,0
I use these for working out. They are incredible. They never fall out because I customized the fit to my ears. And the sound is incredible!,0
I was given the SoundLink for Fathers Day,0
Love my Bose but really would like it if you added a USB port so I could play the music I have on Flashdrives (MP3).,0
Great subwoofer for the size!  Was very pleased with the performance from the get go,0
Superb sound quality considering the size of the speaker. Can be quite loud when I use as for business presentation connected to my computer.  Very useful feature: microphone for phone calls,0
Its one of the best speakers. I had the flip 3 but this Jbl Xtreme is insane the bass is good and it gets loud i love it,0
These are the best in the world just got them they cancel all the outside noise great headphones Bose thx!!!,0

The speaker is very small and the sound is amazing! Just bought it today and don't stop using it! :),0
I used this product for a month,0
It's perfect for my 4 year old. She loves it and I don't have to worry about her listening her shows too loud,0
Love the color options! Purchased this for travel and pool needs. Impressive sound for its size and feels well made. Also love that it is IP7 water resistant,0
Originaly purchased these in mid 80's. the system I had blows anything I have today.they have outlasted the intire system.ROCK ON POLK AUDIO,0
Incredible. These headphones made me realize that my laptop and cellphone had a sound imbalance that I had noticed over the last 6 years. I think that's testament enough of these headphone's solid quality. Looks are also definitely a plus.,0
I love my JBL amazing sound awsome clearity the prices are due able. Oh yea my Fav. Is the loudness Amazing,0
Bose continues to show it is a dependably superior product. My Bose Soundlink Color speaker excels. There are only a few companies that consistently delivers with outstanding service. Bose is one of them! I am not a salesman - just a happy consumer.,0
super center channel speaker even at high volume the sound is so clear and open just a wonderful speaker for the price it cant be beat..,0
I've had this for 6 months and it's the best portable speaker I have seen/heard. The sound quality is great and it looks great too (I have the white one). Can't fault it!,0
I am so happy with these headphones. The sound is so clear! No outside noise coming in. I will definately tell people how great they are,0
a stand out with other speakers of the same price and category,0
Sound quality is excellent and the battery life is absolutely great! Only reason it doesn’t get 5 stars is because it doesn’t go very loud. It does great blocking out other noise and he quality of the sound is there,0
I’ve had my headphones for about a month now and have used them extensively. I’ve used them indoors and outdoors. I’ve even worn them while working out,0
Extremely impressed with the 700!  Doesn’t come with wall mounts... buying Bose equipment is comparable to a fine steakhouse.,0
I find this to be one of the best wired in ear buds. I sleep with headphones on nightly. These are the ones I turn to time and time again because of the comfort. Would buy again.,0
It’s portable and with great sound quality. Holds its charge for hours and can be used for so many different devices,0
I bought this as a christmas gift for my 16 year old step son. He loves it. Very clear and nice sound.,0
This was my first pair of Bluetooth headphones. Connecting was a bit tricky at first but no problems now. Sound quality is good and they sit comfortably on my rather large head! Serves there purpose well.,0
Christmas present for family.   As a floor standing speaker and oversized shelf speaker snob,0
I bought my ES250P in April and I love it. It's awesome! The low level bass is fantastic. I've been a fan of JBL for over a decade and they didn't disappoint with this powered subwoofer. To top it all off,0
This speaker sounds amazing and works very well. Holds a good charge. Only complaint is the flimsiness of the charger. Doesn't keep a snug fit with the outlet.,0
I was looking for something to use every day at the gym as well as while I’m on calls  this is not the headset to use for calls,0
excellent,0
I bought this 2 days ago to enjoy streaming music while sitting outside in the summer.  I LOVE IT!  Clear sound with rich quality.  Jazz never sound so good!,0
I love Bose products I have the Bose Quiet Comfort 15 headphones and today I bought the Soundlink Mini II and I must say that I knew this was the best decision ,0
I bought theses when they first came out and they are the most comfortable headphones I've ever had love them,0
Bought these as just came out. Love them for running. Great sound. Perfect fit.  Listen through technology is neat except for windy day. The mic/s pic up wind noise on breezy day so hard to hear what friend is saying to you.  On calm day no issues!  Overall love them.,0
Bought them for Christmas they are great brilliant sound quality very comfortable,0
Purchased these for my wife's birthday.  She loves these for both her phone and laptop.  Bluethooth paring was very easy.  Sound quality is excellent.,0
I bought these headphones because they would allow me to use them wireless when walking my dog. But they provide audiophile sound with the cable! These headphones really upped the listening experience. My MacBook Pro and and iPhone mate very well and the sound is musical.,0
I wanted a Bluetooth speaker,0
I’ve had the JBL extreme for over year and had to buy another one.  Great sounding speaker good bass and super durable   I keep one of them in the bathroom because I like to listen to music while I’m in the shower I know that’s not the best environment for speaker but I’ve had no problems with it,0
Bought a refurbished series 1 Onyx studio.  Can’t believe how great this speaker is.  My dad loved it so much that he went out to B.B. and bought the series 3.,0
Just got these and they sound amazing!! I have the in-ear sport and on ear wireless headphones and when i received the email about these i had to try them out. Was looking for something wireless and lighter. Went to Bose Store to listen and purchased them on the spot. Nice job BOSE!!,0
Great sound!  I have two pairs in my extended cab Ford Ranger.  After hearing my factory speakers starting to crackle I bought these for their clean sound and solid bass for a speaker of this size.  Well worth the upgrade.,0
I absolutely adore my JBL speaker. I bought it almost 3 years ago and it still works as if it was brand new. Amazing brand and I will definitely be buying more!,0
Qc35's are truely fantastic in  noise reduction and comfort! But picking up calls on my iPhone 6+ is very troubling! If I do manage to pick up a call the sound quality  is not that great.,0
Great for doing chores outside without having to deal with wires getting in the way. Battery life is great too!,0
I bought these speakers a few months ago and they are fantastic! They are a great place to start building your audio setup and I have been sold on the studio 5 speakers simply because of the quality of sound coming from these speakers.,0
I bought this for a Christmas gift for two family members and they are loving it. Great sound,0
I bought this about a week ago and it's been great. Surprisingly good sound,0
Fairly pleased with these J88i's. Comfortable to wear clear mids and highs just wish there was more bass. Overall solid headphones though.,0
I got this speaker as a gift..It has the best sound,0
Looks expensive - until you hear the result. Superb sound from my TV now - on programs,0
I bought these about 4 months ago because I hate the cords always getting on the way when I run. These are loud,0
I've had the jbl pulse for over a year now and it has never let me down. Always sounds good and looks amazing.,0
Best buy in a long time. Love the large sound from the small transportable speaker at a reasonable price,0
Excellent product with excellent sound! These headphones have very nice mids and highs. The bass is tight and controlled. They fit great and are comfortable. These headphones rate right up there with the JBL Synthesis system in my vehicle. Another quality product from JBL!,0
I bought the Flip4 prior to our lake vacation and use on the boat.  It's great and plenty loud!  It's also great in the golf cart if you like to listen while golfing.,0
I received it 3 weeks ago and have not find disadvantages. The sound is loud and clear for such a small thing. Quickly connected to mobile. The charge lasts for a long time. I received all I expected,0
I use these speakers for my Surface Pro 3 Tablet,0
I bought my RM600 here in Brazil,0
Look good,0
I brought this headphones during cyber Monday. I’ve very impressed with the purchase,0
This speaker is great I use I on a daily basis and I had it for al most a year now and I like the clear sound quality and how such a small device can be so loud,0
I've got them for 3 months now,0
Bought for airline travel. Cancels out engines,0
This is the gadget I didn't know I needed. I probably have 5 pairs of headphones. These get used the most. Everyone around me can't hear my music but I sure can! I use this everywhere I go even in the car as a handsfree device. Get them and thank me later.,0
Longtime fan of Bose products for the last 8 years.  I've had different versions of the Bose in ear headphones and picked these up today.  I am in LOVE!!!,0
One pair of each for his and hers,0
I received this speaker last xmas and enjoy the sound BUT have had trouble with the charger connection and now won't charge at all --but over all its a great product --need to return this one,0
Bought them in Las Vegas (duty free) so they were cheaper than the UK,0
For $100,0
